<ap>  With the new iPhones, you can change the aperture after you take the photo.  However, the  <a target=_top href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slør/id1253636766">app Slør</a> is still ahead of its time, enabling the editing of a photo's depth of field and creating tilt-shift effects, as shown in the dog portrait above.  The app works on any iPhone that has portrait mode, not just the new iPhones.  It's  <a target=_top href="https://www.tapsmart.com/apps/photo-video/review-slor-magical-portrait-mode-tool/">a magical portrait mode tool</a>, says Tapsmart in their review.</p>

    <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com"><img src="images/anylist-logo.jpeg" alt="AnyList logo" width="557" height="180"></a> Many iPUG members' favorite list-making app is  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a>. You can use it for your grocery lists or to create any type of list you want. You can share your lists with others and you can optionally sync them across devices: iPhones, iPads, or Macs. As you shop, you can cross off list items on your Apple Watch. You can use <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a> to import recipes and also to plan menus. <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a> is one of the smartest iOS apps.

	Back in 2000, we started out as a group of people who like Palms
	(Palm III's and V's, Treos, Tungstens, Visors, Zodiacs, Cli&eacute;s, etc. -- remember those?). In 2007, a few of us
	got shiny new iPhones (the originals, remember those?), as well as iPod Touches. Today, in 2022, all our members combine both an iPhone and an iPad (or two), and most also use Apple Watches.</p>
	
	<p>
	We get together once a month to discuss the use of our mobile devices, to talk
	about software applications, hardware, and anything else that is
	related to mobile technology. We are not affiliated with Apple, we are just happy nerds who enjoy technology ;-)</p>
	
	<p>
	Our meetings are free and open to all. Everyone is welcome, novices and power users alike.
