<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>


<p class="entry">Today, just a few hours ago, Apple released iOS 18.3.2 with a fix for a severe zero-day flaw -- and  nearly all supported iPhone and iPad models are affected. This is to address  “an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” using older versions of iOS, <a target=_top href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/apple-patches-0-day-exploited-in-extremely-sophisticated-attack/">reports ArsTechnica</a>.

Bloomberg writes: `Apple also is still actively developing a product that would combine AirPods with cameras. The cameras would help power AI features by gathering information on the surrounding environment… Of course, this all hinges on Apple getting its AI in order.'  The cameras would introduce innovative features by incorporating infrared (IR) cameras into the earbuds. These cameras, similar to the IR receiver used in the iPhone’s Face ID system, will not be used for  photos or videos but will instead enhance user interaction  and for  spatial computing and audio experiences, such as gestures and more.

<p class="entry">This is a macOS app:  <a target=_top href="https://tabstolinks.com">TabsToLinks</a> is an app that grabs your open Safari tabs and creates a ist of links.  You can then export this list in an Apple Note, or copy the list and paste it anywhere you wish. This is especially useful for those of us who are tab-o-holics.

<p class="entry"> <a target=_top href="https://www.pawboost.com">PawBoost</a> is a service and an iOS app.  They offer a free service to post a pet that has been lost or a pet that has been found.

<p class="topicTitle">tips & tricks</p>
	
	
<p class="entry"> You can use your Apple Watch, connected to your iPhone's camera app, to `see' live in hard-to-reach areas. For example, need to look under your bed or your car without getting on the floor? Or, need to look inside a hole of a dry wall to look for a stud? Simply open the Camera app on your watch.  This will give you a live view of what your iPhone's camera sees.  Aim your iPhone in the area of interest and you can see on your wrist.  You can also take a photo from your watch. </p>

<p class="entry">Sometimes, you can find yourself clicking on a news or other article but you cannot, as you encounter popups asking for your email, to sign up, to jump several hoops.  Sound familiar?  It can be frustrating.  Oftentimes, if you choose the "reader mode" offered by Safari, you instantly get around all these roadblocks.  This doesn't work 100% of the time, but it's easy to try and it works most of the time.    </p>
