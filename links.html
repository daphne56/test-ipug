<p class="topicTitle">Stores and Resources</p>

<p class="entry">  This list does not attempt to be exhaustive.  It is a list of stores that many of our iPUG members have used and can vouch for.</p>

<p class="entry"> The  <a target=_top href="http://www.apple.com/retail/laencantada/">Apple Store at La Encantada</a>  is an excellent place to get Apple products and (free) help at the genius bar. They also provide free workshops.  The store can get extremely busy, and we recommend making an appointment if you need tech help.  You can do this online, from home, or at the store, when you arrive.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://www.simutek.com/">Simutek</a> is `Southern Arizona's First Apple Specialist', a store that has been around decades before Tucson got an Apple store. Simutek is friendly, knowledgeable, and their repairs are fast and reasonably priced. They also buy and sell used equipment.  You do not need an appointment to get advice or help.</p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://www.shopsws.com/">SWS computers</a> is not Apple-related.  However, it's an excellent store for electronics parts at excellent prices. Their staff knows much, much more than other `big box' electronic stores around Tucson.  Our iPUG members have used them for hard drives, batteries, and other components.</p>

<p class="entry"> If you are in Education, the  <a target=_top href="http://store.apple.com/us_edu_12761">Apple Store at the University of Arizona</a> campus and the online store will give you iOS devices and Macs at discounted prices.</p>

<p class="entry"> <p class="entry"> <a target=_top href="http://www.riseequipmentrecycling.org">Rise</a> is an equipment recycling center.  It provides recycling services to Tucson and Pima County residents. The Recycling Center recycles and refurbishes unwanted computer and electronic equipment. They donate  or sell equipment at a reduced price to non-proft organizations, their clients, and low income families.</p>


 

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://otherworldcomputing.com/">Other World Computing</a> is an online store that sells components for Macs and PCs, used or new Macs.  For example, an iPUG member used them to buy a refurbished Airport Extereme at 67% savings, another member bought 2 SSDs and had them installed in an iMac and a Macbook by Simutek (above).  They guarantee their refurbished equipment.</p>

<p class="entry"> Looking to buy more memory for your Mac? There are countless resources online, of course.  One that we have found very reliable is  <a target=_top href="http://www.crucial.com/mac/index.aspx">Crucial</a> (they also sell DIMMs for PCs, as well as SSDs fro Macs and PCs).  You can buy the parts and do it yourself using their guides.</p>


<p class="topicTitle">Digital Life, Security, Privacy</p> 

<p class="entry"><a target=_top href="http://www.digitalpassing.com">DigitalPassing.com</a> is a blog devoted to estate planning for passwords and digital property, by estate planning attorney Jim Lamm.  Even though he does not discuss Arizona laws, this is an excellent resource. </p>
