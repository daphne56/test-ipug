	<p class="entry"> Apple has  <a target=_top href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2024/11/01/a-new-home-for-pixelmator/">acquired the Pixelmator team</a>.  Pixelmator is a very successful photo editing app.  John Gruber <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/01/pixelmator-apple">discusses possible future directions</a>.  We might see parts of it incorporated in existing Apple app(s) or Apple might move further into the photo editing space and create an Aperture-like follow-on, or a Lightroom or a Photoshop competitor.

Apple is promoting the Wallace & Gromit animation as part of their latest "Shot on iPhone" collection. Aardman, the animation studio that created Wallace & Gromit, filmed the stop-motion video with the Telephoto camera on eight iPhone 16 Pro Max devices.  Apple announced: `From 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. today, and every day until New Year’s Eve, a pair of Christmas trees will light up the two wash towers on the landmark’s river-facing façade. Visitors will see the two characters decorate the giant trees in their own inimitable styles, despite the intervention of the mischievous Feathers McGraw. Aardman follows in the footsteps of David Hockney, who last year created Bigger Christmas Trees, drawn on iPad Pro.'

 <p class="entry">Apple's AirTags have become very popular for traveling and tracking suitcases by passengers.  Soon, with iOS 18.2 (currently in beta),  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/apples-find-my-enables-sharing-location-of-lost-items-with-third-parties/">users will be able to share a secure link with the location of an AirTag or Find My network accessory with others — and soon, with airlines</a>.  `While more than 99 percent of checked items make it to their destination as planned, we know how stressful it can be for customers when they don’t. That’s why we’re excited to support Share Item Location beginning later this year,” said Erik Snell, Delta Air Lines’ senior vice president of Airport Customer Service.'

Apple reports: `Billie Eilish was announced today as Apple Music’s Artist of the Year, recognizing the singer-songwriter’s extraordinary impact throughout 2024.
Following a historic second Academy Award win and two additional GRAMMY Awards for her contribution to Greta Gerwig’s feature-length film Barbie, “What Was I Made For?,” Billie released her third full-length album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. At once vulnerable and bold, it’s the sound of a generational artist taking a massive leap forward — and the best music of her career. Upon release, the album soared to No. 1 on Apple Music’s all-genre albums chart in 138 countries worldwide.'
