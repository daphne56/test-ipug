<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 17</p>

<p class="entry"> iOS 17.0.2 has now been released, as has 17.03 for the iPhone.  It includes some bug fixes.  In the case of the iPhone, this fixes some cases of overheating.</p>

<p class="entry"> The overheating issue has gotten disproportionate attention in the news, as the new iPhone 15 was just released.  Photographer Sebastian de With commented on this: </p>

<p class="entry"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2023. iPhone can take 30s photos at night showing the Milky Way, it can analyze and identify plant species in real-time with AI and send an SOS message to a satellite in space.<br><br>Instagram showing a feed of photos, however, can stress it to the point of heating up to 100+ degrees. <a href="https://t.co/LU5S49f9GX">https://t.co/LU5S49f9GX</a></p>&mdash; Sebastiaan de With (@sdw) <a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1708342409577537952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>



<p class="entry"> iOS 17 offers the new Check-in feature.  Here is how to use it: </p>

<p class="entry"> Here are 17 lesser-known new features in iOS 17.  Some really  good ones: </p>

<p class="entry"> Another cool iOS 17 tip: start Messages. Tap the + to see the pop-up of the apps. Now, long-press an app to select it and drag it up or down to place it where you like. Also, you can drag it down below More to hide it.  Finally, go back to composing a text message, and try long-pressing the + button.  Olga gave a demo of this tip.</p>


<p class="entry"> Sometimes when you want to take a selfie, especially with many people in the frame, it becomes hard to press the button while stretching out your hand as far as possible.  You can take a selfie with Voice Control on iPhone and iPad.  </p>

<p class="entry"> As a reminder,  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210417?cid=tw_sc_accessibility_120320">Use Voice Control on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch</a>.  </p>

<p class="topicTitle">iPhone 15 </p>

<p class="entry"> the new iPhone 15 Pro models offer a new Action button that can be customized to perform an action of the user's choice.  You can do it Settings.  </p>

<p class="entry"> However, one of the clever options is to assign the Action button to a Shortcut.  Roger S. points us to this very creative list of options via Shortcuts, with examples (video by Stephen Robles): </p>

<p class="entry">  The new iPhone 15 has a USB-C connection, ending the Lightning port Apple has used for many years. What can you do with this?  One of the best overviews is provided by Stephen Robles (hat tip to Roger S.):</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://mynoise.net/iOS/theApp.php">myNoise for iOS</a> is an app that plays background sounds.  You can use these to relax, fall asleep to, as white noise, etc. There are many apps of this type but this may be the best of the category. It includes alarms and timers.  The app offers some examples: ` White noise has been scientifically proven to help blocking noises and mask tinnitus. Rain noise works great as a noise blocker too, and is often used in anxiety management and during meditation. Binaural beats are often used in the context of personal growth, mind change and sound therapy. And then, we added Temple Bells and Spring Walk for free as well. Plus, if you open the download tab of our apps, you will find a couple of complimentary generators there too, depending on our mood.' The app is offered in a free and paid version. Olga gave a demo of myNoise.</p>

<p class="entry"> This is a very useful tip for the Apple  macOS Notes app.  If you have a note that you need to reference or consult frequently as you are doing work with some other app,  you can make sure the note stays above other active app windows. 

To do this, double-click on the desired note in the Notes app. This will open the note in its own separate window. Then, use the Window menu and choose `Float on Top'.
