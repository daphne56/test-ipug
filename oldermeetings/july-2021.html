<p class="topicTitle"> WWDC Keynote news </p>



<p class="entry">  Apple held the WWDC keynote last month.  Here is the whole presentation (1 hr + 46 mins long, but chapterized): </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TD96VTf0Xs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>




<p class="entry">  Here is everything Apple announced in 9 mins: </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5VV6Vb_KRQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2021/">Apple's press release summary</a> of the main June 2021 WWDC announcements.</p>



<p class="topicTitle">privacy announcements </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple advances <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/"> its privacy leadership with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8</a>, as summarized in Apple's press release, introducing new features to control and monitor app user data, including: </p>

<p class="entry"> 1). Mail privacy protection (helping avoid the invisible pixels trick) and hiding a user's IP address. </p>

<p class="entry"> 2). A new App Privacy Report, to see how often each app has used the permission a user previously granted to access their location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts during the past seven days. </p>

<p class="entry"> 3). Siri now processes audio requests on the device, by default. This avoids recording a user's audio, the biggest privacy concern about any digital assistant.  Furthermore, many requests do not even require internet access.</p>

<p class="entry"> 4). Introducing iCloud+ which is iCloud plus new premium features, including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support, `at no additional cost'. </p>

<p class="entry"> 5). Introducing Private Relay.  This is a new internet privacy service  built  into iCloud, `allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s network provider.'  Apple's implementation ensures `no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.' In many ways, it's better than a VPN.  But it only applies to Safari (not other web browsers). </p>

<p class="entry"> 6). Introducing Hide My Email.  This lets users `share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private.' </p>

<p class="entry"> 7). Expanded HomeKit Secure Video, so users can connect more video cameras, with end-to-end encrypted storage for home security video footage that will not count against a user's storage capacity.  Additionally, `HomeKit Secure Video also ensures that activity detected by users’ security cameras is analyzed and encrypted by their Apple devices at home before being securely stored in iCloud.' [ This is the opposite of what Ring Amazon cameras do.]</p>

<p class="entry">  There is a lot of confusion about the new iCloud+ but it's actually very simple: iCloud paid plans are now getting renamed as iCloud+ AND they are getting extra privacy features but zero price increase. That's it.  iCloud+ plans:  50GB with one HomeKit Secure Video camera ($0.99 per month), 200GB with up to five HomeKit Secure Video cameras ($2.99 per month), and 2TB with an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video cameras ($9.99 per month).  These plans are the same as today's iCloud plans (in capacity and price), but without the new features listed above.  Recall the   <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238">current iCloud Plans</a> offer entry-level iCloud as a free service at 5GB of storage.  The entry-level & free iCloud service will not include the new features.</p>



<p class="topicTitle"> macOS Monterey</p>

<p class="entry">  Apple has <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-macos-12/">Announced macOS Monterey</a> With Shortcuts App, updated Safari browsing, 'Focus' Do Not Disturb features, and more. </p>

<p class="entry">  Several macOS Monterey Features<a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-features-for-m1-macs-only/"> Not available on Intel-Based Macs</a>, points out Macrumors.  The reason: </p>

<p class="entry"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s because Intel Macs don’t have the neural engine these features require. M1 is an A14X+. T2 is an A10 (pre-ANE). T1 was an S2 (watch SiP). Previous Intel Macs had nothing. These features all lean on the neural engine. <a href="https://t.co/jxqB7LsR2Q">https://t.co/jxqB7LsR2Q</a></p>&mdash; Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) <a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1402677344951803906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>

In idaho, `Tom, who went to the river with his wife and friends, tipped his kayak near the Tilden Bridge Boat Ramp and lost his new phone, keys, fishing pole, and wallet in the swiftly moving current. Although Tom was wearing a lifejacket and managed to swim out of the river unharmed, he was discouraged by all the lost property.'  Later on, a rescue team was able to fish out the iPhone from the river.

	<p class="entry"> Do you sometimes want to read an article online but also prefer instead to listen to it while exercising or cooking, or doing some other activity?

<p class="entry"> With iOS 15, and those who use iCloud+, Safari users will have Private Relay. This feature will ensure your Safari browsing data is encrypted first before leaving your device.  Then your data will be sent through 2 relays (servers). The first server will only see an IP address but not what you are aiming to connect to.
The 2nd relay will see what you want to connect to but not the IP address.  This setup will make it practically impossible for websites and 3rd party aggregators to create profiles on you, including your ISP and many other data brokers.</p>
