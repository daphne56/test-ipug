 <p class="entry"> Olga recommends listening to Sway episode  <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+m_rqByUcU">The Metaverse: Expectations vs. Reality</a>, where Kara Swisher interviews Jaron Lanier.  This is a very interesting interview.  
`Lanier is often called the “godfather of virtual reality,” and his company, VPL Research, developed V.R. goggles and gloves in the 1980s. He says he always imagined a metaverse with “a hundred million micro entrepreneurs doing their little thing here and there — there wouldn’t be some overlord.” Now, as big companies like Roblox and Epic build virtual worlds, he describes how these technologies will continue to shape our lives...</p>

<p class="entry">  
(cont'd) ...In this conversation, Kara Swisher talks to Lanier about Facebook’s pivot to Meta, which he says sounded “like some megalomaniac took my stuff and filtered it through some weird self-aggrandizement filter.” They also discuss why Lanier viewed technologies like automation and V.R. as “a little technological token of that hope of eternal creativity” back in the ’80s. And Lanier, the author of “Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,” makes the case for why Facebook should be paying users for their data. </p>

<p class="entry"> Lanier's view s that Facebook (Meta) would not be embarking in this Virtual reality hardware effort if Apple had not instituted its privacy policies with iOS, iPhones, and iPads.  In Lanier's view, this is Facebook's effort to get personal user information to monetize and sell. </p>

<p class="entry"> You might not always think about it, but as cars can accumulate and save a lot of your location and other info. The WaPo reported on:  <a target=_top href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/17/what-does-your-car-know-about-you-we-hacked-chevy-find-out/">What does your car know about you? We hacked a Chevy to find out</a>.  They write: `Our privacy experiment found that automakers collect data through hundreds of sensors and an always-on Internet connection. Driving surveillance is becoming hard to avoid.' </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width='480' height='290' scrolling='no' src='https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/5a504e58-1263-4e20-9d33-cee8a0ccc6f0' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Among the trove of data points were unique identifiers for my and Doug’s [the car’s owner] phones, and a detailed log of phone calls from the previous week. There was a long list of contacts, right down to people’s address, emails and even photos.` </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Mason has hacked into Fords that record locations once every few minutes, even when you don’t use the navigation system. He’s seen German cars with 300-gigabyte hard drives — five times as much as a basic iPhone 11. The Tesla Model 3 can collect video snippets from the car’s many cameras. Coming next: face data, used to personalize the vehicle and track driver attention.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (Cont'd) `Automakers haven’t had a data reckoning yet, but they’re due for one. GM ran an experiment in which it tracked the radio music tastes of 90,000 volunteer drivers to look for patterns with where they traveled. According to the Detroit Free Press, GM told marketers that the data might help them persuade a country music fan who normally stopped at Tim Horton’s to go to McDonald’s instead.' </p>

<p class="entry">  More recently, Jalopnik reported: <a target=_top href="https://jalopnik.com/the-feds-can-access-the-data-on-your-phone-through-your-1846830499?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=jalopnik_twitter">The Feds Can Access The Private Data On Your Phone Through Your Car</a>.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Is your email Inbox inundated with a lot of email newsletters, subscriptions, and various solicitations and ads?  Consider creating a Mail Rule (on your Mac, for example) that places all emails that contain the word "unsubscribe" into a mailbox. Then you can periodically review this mailbox for items you want and unsubscribe from the rest.   </p>
