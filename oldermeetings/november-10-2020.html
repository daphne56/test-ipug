<p class="topicTitle"> sell / buy used devices </p>


<p class="entry">  A reminder: </p>

<p class="entry"> It’s the season of new iPhones and iPads.  You can consider selling an old device or buying a gently used device. There are many choices: word of mouth, Apple, Craigslist, eBay, Swappa, and more.  </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple sells refurbished devices and also accepts old devices for trade-in and credit toward a new one. It’s an easy choice and it works well. </p>

<p class="entry"> Now that the iPhone 12 Pro Max is out, so is Austin Mann's camera review  <a target=_top href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-12-pro-camera-max-review-zion">camera review from Zion NP, Utah</a>.  </p>


<p class="entry">  Also recall Austin mann's  <a target=_top href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-12-pro-camera-review-glacier">iPhone 12 camera review</a>. For this review, he traveled to  Glacier National Park in Montana.</p>


<p class="entry">  Also, take a look at  iPhone 12 Pro Max Review: <a target=_top href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review">The Best Smartphone Camera You Can Get</a>, writes Nilay Patel for The Verge. He concludes: `While it’s expensive, it’s not that much more expensive than the smaller iPhone 12 Pro: it’s just $100 more at every storage level, starting at $1,099 with 128GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for 512GB of storage. For that money, you get a larger display, a bigger battery, and a very different camera system. I’ll just cut to the chase and say it’s absolutely worth it over the standard 12 Pro if you can deal with the size — but it’s a lot of size. And the camera is worth exploring in depth, because there’s a lot going on.''</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://petapixel.com/2020/11/09/apple-reveals-its-design-philosophy-behind-the-iphone-camera/">Apple Reveals Its Design Philosophy Behind the iPhone Camera</a>. PetaPixel spoke to two Apple executives who outlined the company’s vision and design philosophy behind camera development.   In this interview, with Apple’s Product Line Manager, iPhone Francesca Sweet and Vice President, Camera Software Engineering Jon McCormack, both made clear Apple considers of camera development holistically: it’s not only the sensor and lenses, but also everything from Apple’s A14 Bionic chip, to the image signal processing, to the software behind its computational photography.</p>

<p class="entry"> While we got the good news about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, the expectation is that it will become available in the Spring 2021, or mid-2021 for the majority of Americans. Meanwhile, COVID-19 infections are on the rise.  The latest episode of  In the Bubble podcast gives us practical information for  <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+hphMcFB9U">Toolkit: How to Stay Safe in COVID Winter</a>.    </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) The podcast host, Andy Slavitt, interviews Infectious diseases physician Dr. Nahid Bhadelia and indoor air quality expert Richard Corsi answer every tough question about winter safety – from holiday gatherings, to indoor dining, and flu season. Understand what’s happening with indoor particles and how to make sure homes, offices, and schools can be as safe as possible with ventilation, filters, and CO2 meters. Dr. Nahid Bhadelia is the Director of Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center.  Dr. Richard Corsi is Dean at the College of Engineering & Computer Science, Portland State University.</p>
 

<p class="entry"> Here is a very detailed <a target=_top href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1fB5pysccOHvxphpTmCG_TGdytavMmc1cUumn8m0pwzo/mobilebasic">FAQs on Protecting Yourself from COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission</a>, written by Dr. Richard Corsi. </p>

<p class="entry">  Another podcast of interest is  Kara Swisher's Sway episode interview of Lina Khan:  <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+he8HeoaDs">She’s Bursting Big Tech’s Bubble</a>. Description: `It  looks as if Big Tech may face some breakups. Lawmakers are interrogating tech C.E.O.s on Capitol Hill while the Justice Department pursues a landmark antitrust case against Google. For decades, tech giants have avoided such scrutiny — hiding behind the idea that their products are free, beneficial, even beloved.
Lina Khan says this is no excuse for a monopoly.
As a 28-year-old law student, Ms. Khan published a single scholarly article that greatly shifted America’s antitrust debate. Three years later, she remains an existential threat to companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple.' </p>
