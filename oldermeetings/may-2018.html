	<p class="entry">  Today, Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">announced 2Q results</a>.  The iPhone X remains the most popular model (unlike rumors from analysts before today’s announcements from Apple). `We’re thrilled to report our best March quarter ever, with strong revenue growth in iPhone, Services and Wearables,’ said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. `Customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. We also grew revenue in all of our geographic segments, with over 20% growth in Greater China and Japan.` </p>

 <p class="entry">  Note that as you rotate the digital crown, the kaleidoscope goes through the entire seed image (eventually getting to the green parts, not only the orange parts shown above). Olga’s recommendation is to use a seed image whose colors you like, make sure colors  have pleasing contrasts, and preferably use images that do not have a lot of white, as the watch face always maintains white clock dials, unlike the complications whose colors change as the kaleidoscope rotates.</p>

	<p class="topicTitle"> Facebook, the meltdown </p>

<p class="entry"> This past month, Facebook’s `perfect storm’ became public. Though it seems FB itself has known about this since 2015. Supposedly ‘87’ Millions users' personal data and profile descriptions were given and taken by political consultants and used for political campaigns. Users were micro-targeted with political `ads’ (i.e., shown false facts as a way to manipulate opinions).  The '87’ million claim is a low number, as FB has admitted all 2 Billion their users are exposed to this type of targeting. </p>

<p class="entry">  Some reports refer to what has happened as a `data breach’. This is not accurate. Facebook enabled a breach of trust and an abuse that it set up and enabled with full awareness, despite warnings. Facebook did not have a security failure. What happened is consistent with FB’s business model: they collect a mountain of personal data from users, create detailed profiles based on user activity, and sell the info for profit to advertisers and other businesses. Many of these businesses create their own Facebook `apps’ that automatically collect the user’s personal data plus Facebook’s profile info, depending on each app.  </p>

<p class="entry"> In this case, Facebook provided an app all the data they had legitimately paid for.  The app also collected data from the friends of the users. (While this stretched the agreement that FB made with the app’s developers, this was easily enabled by Facebook’s own structures and business model.)  When Facebook learned about this (a couple of years ago), they merely sent a form to the developers asking them to confirm they deleted the extra data. Facebook did not ensure the data was ever deleted. The whole incident was kept quiet.  </p>


<p class="entry"> Now that the scandal is public, Facebook ousted the whistleblower (who was a simple FB user).  However, Facebook continues to employ one of the two researchers who was responsible for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p>
