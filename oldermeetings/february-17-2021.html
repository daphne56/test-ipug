<p class="entry"> Tim Cook  <a target=_top href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2420733/tim-cook-apple-fitness-wellness-future">wants to make health and wellness Apple’s greatest legacy</a>, reports Outside Magazine.  The article includes a podcast interview with Tim Cook.  This is very worthwhile reading & listening to, as it gives a perspective of Cook’s thinking and philosophy that we don’t often get from various other quick interviews. </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2021/2/11/apple-watch-is-now-worn-on-100-million-wrists">Apple Watch Is Now Worn on 100 Million Wrists</a>, as estimated by market analysis by Above Avalon. Also, `As of the end of 2020, approximately 10% of iPhone users were wearing an Apple Watch. This is a high percentage given the diverse technological wants and needs of those in the iPhone installed base.’ </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple <a target=_top href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/11/apple-looks-to-make-sleep-tracking-unobtrusive-with-slim-bed-sensors">looks to make sleep tracking unobtrusive with slim bed sensors</a>, speculates and reports AppleInsider. `As well as Apple's acquisition of Beddit for its technology, the company has been persistently pursuing new methods of tracking sleep as part of its health features. Two newly-revealed patent applications suggest that it is particularly focusing on devices that can be laid upon a bed, yet not disturb the very sleep they're intended to monitor.’</p>

Here is  <a target=_top href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10919482">the Apple patent `Airbag-based occupant safety system’</a>.</p>

<p class="entry">  Facebook's Zuckerberg <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-meets-apple-in-clash-of-the-tech-titanswe-need-to-inflict-pain-11613192406">tells staff to ‘inflict pain’ on Apple </a>, as privacy battle escalates, reports the WSJ.  Mark Zuckerberg told staffers that FB needs to “inflict pain” on Apple due to their efforts to protect  user privacy, which stands in the way of Facebook’s business model.  The FB model relies on collecting personal user data and tracking users without explicit consent in order to sell targeted advertising. In other words, the individual Facebook user is the product, not the customer, and Apple's privacy protection is impeding this in a fundamental way.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wakeout-active-breaks/id1242116567">WakeOut</a> won  <a target=_top href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/best-of-2020/#apps-of-the-year">Best App of the Year in 2020</a>, as we saw in our previous iPUG meeting.  Olga reports using it for the past few weeks and recommends it highly. It’s deceptively simple but effective in helping you insert brief periods of movement throughout the day.  There are morning wake-out video clips, mid-day, and even wind-down for bedtime. It’s very enjoyable and customizable. You can send a movement video clip to someone even if they do not have an iPhone. This is especially useful for those working from home during the pandemic or lockdowns, stuck at a desk most of the day: the app offers enjoyable breaks and even includes desk exercises, hand and neck stretches, and more. But it also offers brief exercises for anyone, in any shape or situation. To use the app, you need to enable a subscription but you can try it out for a month for free by canceling before payment is due, as they describe. (Paid subscriptions continue otherwise, by month for $5/mo or $25/year for a family.)  Here is their  <a target=_top href="https://ineedabreak.work/faq">FAQ page</a>. </p>	

	

<p class="entry"> This is delightful and practical, like Google Earth for radio across the globe:  <a target=_top href="http://radio.garden/">Radio.garden</a> lets you move around the map and listen to radio stations live.  You can do it on a web browser and there is an    

 <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/radio-garden-live/id1339670993">app for iOS</a>.  Here is   <a target=_top href="http://radio.garden/visit/tucson-az/vsiqXOYc">Tucson-based radio station KUAT</a>. </p>	
	
	
	
	
<p class="entry">  Pat points us to <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripwhistle-global-sos-international-emergency-phone/id839654331">TripWhistle</a>, an app to help you when you are having an emergency. It provides international emergency phone Numbers (911, 112, etc.) for travelers.  (It is notale that the app asks for permission to access all your contacts.  Olga reports trying the app and declining access to contacts.) </p>

<p class="entry">   [ DEMO ] New collaboration feature by <a target=_top href="https://www.goodnotes.com">GoodNotes</a>.  Recall that GoodNotes is a natural note-taking app we have talked about in the past.  They have just added the ability to collaborate with others. Multiple people can work on the same notebook or the same page simultaneously.   To do so, send in invitation link to someone, via text message. This can be very handy especially during a pandemic lockdown but for any situation with remote collaborators. </p>
