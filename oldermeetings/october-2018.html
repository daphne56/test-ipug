<p class="entry"> With iOS 12, Apple has incorporated a lot of smarts.  One example is when engaging the Do Not Disturb function (go to Control Center) on her new iPhone, Olga wanted to stop all interruptions during a theater performance.  Pressing and holding the DND moon icon, Olga got this set of options (screenshot below).  Very smart! </p>

 <p class="entry">  Did you know that iOS has an emoji depicting a man with a beard in a spa? You might think it is not used much, but it was recently used by Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, in  <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/technology/marc-benioff-time-magazine-meredith.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology">a funny an illuminating interview with the NY Times</a>. </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Recall also that, as Kandie has pointed out, iOS has  <a target=_top href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/2017/10/06/apple-introduces-gender-neutral-emoji...-and-mermaids/106364456/">a male mermaid, in addition to a female version</a>. </p>

Starting with iOS 12 and watchOS 5, Apple now lets you choose when you want to receive navigation alerts on Apple Watch.’ </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  With iOS 12, comes a `hidden’ feature’  <a target=_top href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3307437/mobile-wireless/this-small-ios-12-feature-is-the-birth-of-a-whole-industry.html">that could be the birth of a whole industry</a>, Jonny Evans writes Computerworld. `Imagine if you had a low-weight imaging format you could use to transmit a huge quantity of data about an object, such as an image that included height, weight, depth data. That’s exactly what iOS 12’s clever USDZ imaging format provides, and it’s a building block for far more powerful augmented reality (AR) experiences in the future.’  He continues:</p>
 
 <p class="entry"> `Apple at WWDC 2018 put its weight behind USDZ, a format developed with Pixar and supported by Adobe. This is now supported by iOS 12, and Apple has put command line tools in Xcode 10 that will easily convert 3D models to the format. Just as imaging formats such as TIFF, JPEG, GIF, and even PDF unleashed a big revolution in desktop publishing, AR imaging formats such as USDZ will enable a whole new class of industries and industrial applications of AR. </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Evans also writes, `I spoke with Louis Jonckheere, chief product officer at Showpad, to learn his thoughts on this. `AR is starting to become more mainstream for both consumer and enterprise applications, but still doesn’t have a file format that people agree on,’ Jonckheere explained. ‘If a critical mass of people adopt a single file format, such as USDZ, we could see augmented reality applications become even more prevalent. </p>
 
 
 
 <p class="entry">  iOS 12.1 Beta is already available for testing, and it includes  <a target=_top href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/20/first-ios-12-1-public-beta-with-group-facetime-now-available-along-with-tvos-12-1/">group FaceTime</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is a thorough and very detailed overview,  <a target=_top href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c">The iPhone XS: Why It Is a Whole New Camera</a>, writes Halide. </p>

<p class="entry">  A brief summary of Halide’s careful review is this: The iPhone XS is merging exposures and is reducing brightness in brighter areas and reduces darkness in shadows. The detail is still there, but we see it as less sharp due to changes in local contrast. So, photos with subjects in the dark  get this smoothed out. The iPhone XS has more  noise reduction than previous models.
Halide’s tests show that the iPhone XS camera favors higher ISO and faster shutter speeds, resulting in faster photos, but higher noise.  To counter the noise, iOS 12’s new Smart HDR feature is taking several photos and stitching them together, applying more noise reduction. This can also result in some loss of detail and local contrast. It can be seen in selfies that were previously blown out (with a light source behind the subject) with more smoothing and less detail. </p>

He was then notified that his heart rhythm was not normal.  It detected patterns suggesting Atrial Fibrillation.  He gives a lot of details in his article. He concludes: `I owe my life to my Apple Watch. Because it started this whole machine rolling. And I was very lucky to have my Afib caught during the last three months of public enrollment in the Heart Study, which ended in early August. I've decided that I will be an Apple Watch customer as long as that product exists. That means I'm also going to be an iPhone customer for life as well. So heck yeah, I'm getting a new iPhone XS when the upgrade program kicks in. And a new iPad Pro.''</p>

<p class="entry"> 7-Eleven  <a target=_top href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/10/apple-pay-7-eleven/">now accepts Apple pay</a>. `Frictionless experiences are the future, and digital payments are key to such experiences. Consumers prefer shopping at retailers that offer digital payment capabilities. The ability to pay with their smart device gives consumers one more reason to shop at 7-Eleven,' said Gurmeet Singh CDO and CIO of 7-Eleven. </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga discovered an unexpected benefit of Apple Pay.  The credit card associated with her Apple Pay is in fact her simple debit checkcard which she uses for 99% of her purchases.  The day before a trip, she went to an ATM and used the (physical) card to make a cash withdrawal, got distracted at the end of the transaction, and left her debit card in the ATM.  When she realized it about 20 minutes later, the ATM had already shredded and destroyed the card.  However, Olga realized that the financial institution whose ATM automatically destroyed the debit card (for security reasons), did not notify the other financial institution that issued the debit card (as there is no security concern at that point).  So, Olga tested whether Apple Pay would still work.  She was glad to verify that it did (since the account was still good), and was able to continue using Apple pay on her trip without missing a beat. </p>

<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/apple-tech-scandals.html">How Apple has Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals</a>, writes the NY Times. `Because Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices. Though it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech’s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.’ </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/09/30/feds-force-suspect-to-unlock-apple-iphone-x-with-their-face/#1f2c5ef91259">Feds Force Suspect To Unlock An Apple iPhone X With Their Face</a>, reports Forbes. This is a legally interesting case that could set new precedents. They write:  `Thus far, there’s been no challenge to the use of Face ID in this case or others. But Fred Jennings, a senior associate at Tor Ekeland Law, said they could come thanks to the Fifth Amendment, which promises to protect individuals from incriminating themselves in cases. In previous rulings, suspects have been allowed to decline to hand over passcodes, because the forfeiture of such knowledge would amount to self-incrimination. But because the body hasn’t been deemed a piece of knowledge, the same rulings haven’t been applied to biometric information, like fingerprints or face scans. That’s despite the fact that the use of passcodes, fingerprints and faces on an iPhone has the same effect in each case: unlocking the device.’ </p>
