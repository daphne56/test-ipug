Ben Sin  writes: `I've been testing a beta version of iPadOS for the past few days, and most of the improvements Apple promised are already useable here in the beta software. They're slightly buggy right now – as is often the case with beta software – but by the time these are consumer-ready, the iPads, especially the 2018 iPad Pro, is going to become significantly more capable.' </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga has previously recommended  <a target=_top href="https://aaptiv.com">Aaptiv</a>.  They were by far the best.  They recently went through a very disruptive change and they are rebuilding their service and offerings.  Despite the changes, it's still among the better choices and it's worth considering. </p>

<p class="entry"> Another fitness app that gets high reviews is  <a target=_top href="https://www.onepeloton.com/digital">Peloton</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Another app worth considering is  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seven-7-minute-workout/id650276551?mt=8&ct=TOD_SC02_PT069_US_SI650276551&ign-itsct=TOD_SC02_PT069_US_SI650276551&ign-itscg=as10001">Seven</a>, a quick 7 min workout app for those who are very busy.   </p>

Consider  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/findy-com/id1289678234?ls=1">Findy</a> (iTunes link) or <a target=_top href="https://findy.com">Findy</a> (Dev website).  It is an app that helps your searches for items you are considering buying. They say: `Still using a search engine to actually search? Still using Craigslist to navigate classifieds? And still using Pinterest to organize and share your favorites? Then you're probably finding more ads, duplicates, scams, and sponsored results than actual results, right?' Findy claims to `get you there faster by eliminating redundancy and prioritizing results without compromising your privacy.' </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://www.pauseable.com">PauseAble</a> offers 2 apps to guide you to mindfulness via interactive meditation: Pause and Sway:  </p>

From simply moving your phone in your hand while sitting down or lying in bed, to  swaying your body while waiting for the bus or even walking slowly around the office, the app is designed to help you find focus in everyday life using interactive meditation.  Reviews are mixed, some people say it's a great idea but feels only partially finished.</p>

<p class="entry"> How  <a target=_top href="https://www.subtraction.com/2019/07/02/how-i-dropped-dropbox/">I Dropped Dropbox</a>, writes Khoi Vinh. He writes:</p>

<p class="entry"> `There are so many Dropbox integrations available that the service seems essential, or at least difficult to imagine doing without. Over the years I’ve hooked numerous apps and services into my Dropbox account, which is why I started paying for the professional plan seven years ago. And yet each year, at renewal time, I think a bit more deeply about the question of whether Dropbox is in fact so indispensable. It’s not.` </p>

<p class="entry"> He continues: `Last month, Dropbox's unique value was even further diminished for me when Apple announced that folder sharing would soon be coming to iCloud Drive. This replicates fully the most compelling reason I had to stick with Dropbox: the ability to give other users access to my select folders directly in the macOS Finder. That, combined with Dropbox's recent announcement that it would be increasing the annual cost of my pro plan by US$20 at renewal time, convinced me to finally cancel my subscription.' </p>
