The first is to introduce a way that OTP SMS messages can be associated with an URL. This is done by adding the login URL inside the SMS itself.
The second goal is to standardize the format of 2FA/OTP SMS messages, so browsers and other mobile apps can easily detect the incoming SMS, recognize web domain inside the message, and then automatically extract the OTP code and complete the login operation without further user interaction. By doing this, the process of receiving and entering a one-time passcode could be automated, eliminating the risk of a user falling for a scam and entering an OTP code on a phishing site, with the wrong URL.' </p>

The result has transformed frustrating experiences with web apps that simply didn’t work before on the iPad into a productive environment for accomplishing tasks that once required a Mac.'   </p>



<p class="topicTitle">  photography & video</p>


<p class="entry"> One of the significant new features with iPhone 11 is Night Mode. Depending on how dark the scene is, your iPhone might take a Night mode photo quickly, or it might extend the shutter time for several seconds. A number appears next to the Night mode icon to indicate how long the shot will take.</p>

<p class="entry">  
To experiment with longer Night mode photos, tap the Night mode icon. Then use the slider above the shutter button to choose between Auto and Max. Auto lets the camera decide how long to shoot, and Max takes the longest Night mode shot. When you take the photo, the slider becomes a timer that counts down to the end of the exposure. Be sure to hold still until the capture completes. Here is a report on its use, take a look at the photos: </p>

<p class="entry">  Using iPhone’s ‘Night Mode’ to <a target=_top href="https://petapixel.com/2019/12/19/using-iphones-night-mode-to-shoot-40-days-of-darkness-in-russias-north/">Shoot 40 Days of Darkness in Russia’s North</a>, reports Petapixel. `For my latest photo essay Forty Days Of Darkness', I bought the new iPhone 11 Pro and went to Russia's Murmansk, the biggest city in the Arctic circle. From December until January the sun never rises over Murmansk. With the iPhone camera (most of the time) set to night mode, I shot life in the darkness there. Most young people we spoke to said they didn’t mind the winter, when northern lights sparkle in the sky and snow covers the ground. One hotel receptionist said, Anyway, summer only really lasts a week or two and the winter is beautiful here. I prefer it.' </p>

<p class="entry"> Stephen King <a target=_top href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/03/stephen-king-quit-facebook/"> quits Facebook over ‘flood of false information’ and privacy concerns</a>, reports The Washington Post. `Announcing his decision to his millions of Twitter followers Friday, the prolific horror writer joined a chorus of criticism toward the social media giant as it resists pressure to remove false claims from politicians. Facebook also opted last month to keep the tools that help politicians and other groups target its users, adding to fears it will mislead voters in the 2020 presidential race.' </p>



<p class="entry"> Apple delivered a significant update to Maps with the recent update to iOS 13 last month. In their announcement, they also highlighted privacy: </p>

<p class="entry"> Maps and Privacy:  `Apple is committed to keeping personal information safe and has built privacy into the core of Maps. With Maps, no sign-in is required and it is not connected to an Apple ID in any way. Personalized features, such as suggesting departure time to make the next appointment, are created using on-device intelligence. Any data collected by Maps while using the app, like search terms, navigation routing and traffic information, is associated with random identifiers that continually reset to ensure the best possible experience and to improve Maps. Maps goes even further to obscure a user’s location on Apple servers when searching for a location through a process called “fuzzing.” Maps converts the precise location where the search originated to a less-exact one after 24 hours and does not retain a history of what has been searched or where a user has been.' </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/08/fbi-apple-pensacola-shooter">FBI vs. Iphone Encryption, Round Two: Pensacola Shooter</a>, writes John Gruber, an his succinct column on this matter. `There are two entirely separate issues here, and the FBI either doesn’t understand them or (more likely, I think, but I’m not sure) is willfully conflating them.' </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-14/iphone-hacking-firm-updates-tool-in-midst-of-apple-fbi-spat">iPhone Hacking Firm Updates Tool in Midst of Apple-FBI Spat</a>, reports Bloomberg. The forensics firm Cellebrite has released a new update its UFED Physical Analyzer software that could be used to access data on iPhones -- including  the Pensacola Islamic terrorist’s iPhones at the center of the latest battle between Apple and the U.S. government in recent weeks.  Many analysts point out that this instance is being leveraged as a way to pressure Apple to unlock all iPhones, i.e., to provide a backdoor.  Apple strongly resists this. </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/apple-privacy-executive-defends-encryption-after-fbi-request">Apple Privacy Executive Defends Encryption After FBI Request</a>, reports Bloomberg. `Horvath says iPhone health, payment data must be protected.'</p>

<p class="entry"> The article above also reports that Apple's Senior Director of Global Privacy Jane Horvath said, during a panel discussion at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas: `iPhones are prone to be lost or stolen, so Apple needs to make sure the devices are encrypted to protect data such as health and payment information'. </p>  


<p class="entry">  (cont'd): `She also called terrorism and child sexual abuse `abhorrent' and stressed that Apple helps law enforcement with investigations every day. Apple regularly responds to warrants by giving investigators access to data that is stored on its servers, such as users’ iCloud account information. However, the company has refused in the past to help authorities unlock iPhones to get on-device data. It has also argued that iPhone security and encryption mean that it can’t access such information even if it wanted to [do so].' </p>

<p class="entry">  Here is Apple's <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">Privacy and Government Requests</a> information page. `Apple has never created a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services. We have also never allowed any government direct access to Apple servers. And we never will.'</p>
