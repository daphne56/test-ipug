<p class="entry">  Apple has just released new  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, with active noise cancellation (ANC) and significantly improved bass range, for an `immersive’ sound experience.  The AirPods offer a `transparency” mode’ for those times when you do not want ANC’.  Furthermore, the fit has improved with silicone tips that create a snug seal in the ear; three different tip sizes come with each AirPod pair. A single charge lasts 4.5 hrs with ANC or 5 hrs without anything.  A 5-minute recharge gives you another hour of play. And you cn get 24 hrs of listening time with multiple additional charges via the case.   </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 13</p>

<p class="entry"> Voice Control is a new feature with iOS 13.  To turn it on,  tap Settings >Accessibility >Voice Control. David Pogue discusses Voice Control in iOS 13. He says: `Man... not sure this feature got enough press. It lets you do EVERYTHING on the phone hands-free. In some ways, it's like Siri, except you don't have to hold down any buttons or say "Hey Siri" or anything. You just TALK. The phone ignores you until you say a command it understands. (You can also set it so that it listens only when you're LOOKING at the phone.) Pretty cool.' Take a look at Pogue’s demo:</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfGl2qCrVcU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> With iOS 13, screenshots can be saved to Files instead of your Photo gallery.  After you take a screenshot, select Save to Files. </p>

<p class="entry"> You can tap and hold links in Safari to `peek’ and see a preview of a page without opening it. </p>

<p class="entry"> Peek capability is available when you tap and hold an app’s icon on the desktop: you will get a menu pop up with options. </p>

<p class="entry"> Low Data Mode: go to Settings > Cellular > Options > Low Data Mode.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Optimized battery charging: Settings > Battery > Health.  This learns your routine and aims to charge past 80% only when you are expected to need it.  This improves battery longevity.</p>

<p class="entry"> Searching Notes now includes searching images with text as OCR has been enabled with iOS 13 in Notes. </p>

<p class="entry">  In Notes, you can now share a folder of notes with others. To do so, you can go to all your notes, tap the icon on the upper right (circle with ellipses), tap select notes,  and select some notes of your choice.  Then tap `Move To.. ‘ on the bottom and create a New Folder. Name the new folder.  Now tap its name and choose Add People.</p>

<p class="entry">  When you are about to share photos, you can remove EXIF data before sharing -- a nice option if you consider your privacy before sharing on social media or in general.  After you select the photos you want to share, tap the share button.  Then tap Options, at the top. You can uncheck the location and other data before you share the photo(s). </p>

<p class="entry">  With iOS 13, there are better privacy settings.   Settings > Privacy > Location services.  Tap on any app name from the list presented.  You will now see a new option: ask next time.   This is new, giving better control for times when you do not want to revoke location services permanently.  </p>

<p class="entry"> In Settings > Privacy there is a new sub-menu under Bluetooth.  This lists apps that use Bluetooth in ways other than streaming videos. Review these to decide whether you want them to access your iOS device via bluetooth. </p>

<p class="entry">  on iPhone, you can silence Unknown Callers (go to Settings > Phone).   You can avoid robocallers, sending them straight to voice mail without making your phone ring, buzz, or display a notification; only from people in your Contacts and people you’ve called yourself. Be cautious though: if you expect a call from someone whose number you don't know it will go to voicemail as well. </p>
