<p class="topicTitle">photography </p>


<p class="entry"> Apple makes use of computational photography to improve a photo taken by an iPhone or iPad.  Some other companies apply a similar approach, with varying degrees of success.  However, Samsung has taken this in a very different direction:</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/13/samsung-fake-moon-shots-controversy/">Samsung device takes fake moon photos</a>, writes user... on Reddit.  In a nutshell, Samsung uses AI to recognize when a user photographs the moon and replaces the user's photo with another photo of the moon that is higher res and has more detail! In other words, it does not improve the user's photo, it replaces the user's photo. Read his post that offers a lot of careful experiments to prove his allegations.</p>

<p class="entry"> Olga reported noticing that the  `Featured Photo' option in iOS Photos often chooses photos of what she's missing while traveling, e.g. Tucson and her dogs are featured.  And vice versa:  after I returning home from a trip, the Featured photos show travel highlights. Apple's algorithms are sophisticated. </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMV9VMT/">Arlo Essential Wired Doorbell</a> is also on sale for Prime Day (67% off at $49). </p>

<p class="entry"> The Wirecutter,  by the NY Times,  <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-smart-doorbell-camera/">writes</a>: `The Arlo Essential Video Doorbell Wired is our top pick because‚Äîalong with its great hardware and fast response times‚Äîit can accurately distinguish among people, animals, vehicles, or packages. This means it also keeps false alerts (a problem with many other models) to a minimum. For that advanced sensing and the ability to capture video clips up to five minutes long, you need a $4-per-month Arlo Secure subscription (which is going up to $5 per month starting in February 2023). But we find these features to be essential, and the price is fair (otherwise you‚Äôre restricted to motion/bell alerts and live video streaming). The Arlo doorbell camera also captures crisp video, with a 1536√ó1536 resolution and a wide, 180-degree viewing angle in a square format; this provides a comprehensive vertical and horizontal view of what‚Äôs going on in front of your door, whether it‚Äôs deliveries or visiting raccoons.' </p>
