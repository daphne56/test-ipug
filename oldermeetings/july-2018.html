Apple writes:  `An Easy Way to Follow the Elections, With Reporting From Trusted Sources Curated by Apple News Editors’. Also: `providing a new resource for timely, trustworthy midterm election information and helping news seekers access the most important reporting and analysis from a diverse set of publishers.’  This is a valuable resource for readers.  Apple clearly also draws a contrast vs. other news aggregating algorithms that fall prey to fake news (<cough> Facebook <cough, cough>). </p>

<p class="topicTitle">tips & tricks</p>
	

<p class="entry"> Recall that Messages is encrypted end-to-end when the chat is between Apple users.  (Blue text.) It is not encrypted when the app is used to text non-Apple users (green text.)</p>

<p class="entry">  This means that between Apple users, the benefit of encryption makes Messages safer and more private that email. If you need to send someone sensitive info (an account number or a password, if you must) don't use email for sensitive info.  But you can use Messages, thanks to encryption, as long as it goes to another Apple user.</p>

<p class="entry">  What if someone sent you important / sensitive info several days ago and you cannot find it easily?  Here is a way: </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.iphonelife.com/blog/32671/tip-day-how-search-message-conversations">How to Search Message History on iPhone</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  Another way to do it, is to use <a target=_top href="https://flexibits.com/chatology">Chatology</a> on your Mac.  Olga recommends it. </p>

    
<p class="entry"> If you forgot your Apple ID,  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201487">you can reset the password</a>.  If you have problems with your Apple ID   <a target=_top href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=psp&PRKEYS=PF23">Reach out to Apple here</a>.  </p>

<p class="entry">  If you have an iPhone, chances are you have many photos.  Maybe too many. How do you find a photo from several months ago? Olga recommends searching by key word (such as dog).  Another good way to search is by month.  For example, type November, and you will find all photos taken in November of any year.  This is a surprisingly useful feature. </p>

<p class="entry">  Here is the path by Apple Watch.  Green parts mean fast speed which mean hot grass, which means there is no tree.  Red portions are slow movement, so they are savored. Red spots are the trees!  Park can be mapped. :-) </p>
