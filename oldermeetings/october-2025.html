He concludes: `Overall, iOS 26’s quality of life improvements are what are likely to resonate the most, and there’s something here for most of us. Who wants to be stuck on hold, or get spam calls and messages, after all? How about the ability to talk with people in different languages, or remember that place you went to six months ago? Who isn’t glad to have the ability to record a podcast on their phone? (Is that just me? It might be just me.)'

<p class="entry">Arstechnica  <a target=_top href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-air-review-apples-different-est-phone-in-years-is-appealing-despite-itself/">reviewed the new iPhone Air</a> in a thorough review. `Apple’s iPhone Air is a bunch of small changes that add up to something big.' They conclude: `Like that original MacBook Air, the iPhone Air clearly leaves room for improvement. But also like the MacBook Air, I wouldn't be totally surprised to see the iPhone Air become the template for what a "normal" iPhone looks like a few years down the road. And who knows what Apple could decide to build on the Air's slim foundation: maybe two of them, joined in the middle by a hinge?'

 <p class="entry"> <a target=_top href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-17-pro-max?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email">Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max review: The mighty workhorse we needed</a>, writes Mashable.   They conclude: `The 17 Pro Max is the best iPhone, period. It has a large, beautiful display, excellent cameras, and long battery life. If you can afford it, buy it.
The only potential drawbacks worth considering are the size and the weight. It’s a big, heavy phone, and if you slap on a case (which, again, you probably should), it’s going to be even heavier. The iPhone 17 Pro has almost exactly the same specs, but it’s smaller and lighter, making it a better fit for some people. As for the iPhone Air, it’s the slimmest, nicest-looking, sexiest phone in the new lineup, but its camera system is leagues behind the one on the Pro models.'

 <p class="entry">Photographer Austin Mann reviews the new camera capabilities of the iPhone 17 Pro: <a target=_top href="https://www.austinmann.com/trek/iphone-17-pro-camera-review-dolomites">BUONGIORNO FROM THE DOLOMITE MOUNTAINS!</a>   He concludes with advice for photographers, and includes this in his summary: `The standout upgrade in this year’s iPhone Pro is clearly the 4x 48MP camera—along with the new 8x telephoto. Each year, Apple reduces the need for extra hardware—this time, cutting down on the need for external telephoto lenses.
At the end of the day, what matters most is using whatever tools we have to fully express our artistic vision and with the iPhone 17 Pro, you’re equipped to pursue just about any vision to the fullest.'

 <p class="entry">Olga reported getting these Airpods pro 3 and loves them.  There are many improvements over the previous generation which she already found to be excellent.  The battery life being 8 hours is a significant jump from 6 hours.  Additionally, you can leave them out of their charging case and they will not drain down to zero. The sound is excellent, with bass improved.  The noise cancellation has improved.  And the ear fit is more secure with the new hidden foam under the part that fits in your ear. Olga considers these one of the best products made by Apple. </p>

The hack is very simple and clever every day, do a search in your Photo app for all photos that match today's date.  Review the results and delete the ones you don't need.  This spreads the reviews to a limited set so it's not overwhelming.  Over time, you will have reviewed all your photos. (In fact, you might feel inspired to do a few extra days at a time, speeding things up, but this method does not ask for too much at any time.)

<p class="entry">Recall that Apple suggests  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102672">using Micellar water</a> when cleaning yoru Airpods.  There are many brands you can use. One example is this:  <a target=_top href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006RBR7NO/">Micellar water</a> which comes in a small bottle and is under $6.
