<p class="entry">Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/apple-introduces-digital-id-a-new-way-to-create-and-present-an-id-in-apple-wallet/">introduces Digital ID</a>, a new way to create and present an ID in Apple Wallet. `Digital ID offers a secure and private way for users to create an ID in Apple Wallet using information from their U.S. passport, and present their ID with iPhone or Apple Watch.'  

 </p>
 
 <p class="entry">(cont'd) `At launch, Digital ID acceptance will roll out first in beta at TSA checkpoints at more than 250 airports in the U.S. for in-person identity verification during domestic travel, with additional Digital ID acceptance use cases to come in the future.' [ . . . ] `The launch follows the capability for users to add an eligible driver’s license and state ID to Apple Wallet. If users do not have a U.S. passport to create their Digital ID, they can still add an eligible driver’s license to Apple Wallet.' </p>
 
 <p class="entry">As a reminder,  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111803">you can add  your driver's license to Apple Wallet</a>.

 </p>


	<p class="entry"> Apple's  <a target=_top href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53965725">iPhone 17 sales are at record high</a>.   The  iPhone 17 lineup is selling so well that Apple is on track to ship more than 247.4 million total iPhones in 2025, according to the IDC. `In China, Apple's largest market, massive demand for iPhone 17 has significantly accelerated Apple's performance. It ranked first in October and November per IDC's China Monthly Sales data with more than 20% share, miles ahead of the competition, leading IDC to revise Apple's Q4 forecast in China from 9% to 17% YoY. This turns a previously projected 1% decline in China for 2025 into a positive 3% growth, that's a phenomenal turnaround. '

 <p class="entry">Apple released a 2-minute film that was shot on iPhone, titled A Critter Carol | Shot on iPhone 17 Pro.  `In this handcrafted film, a ragtag group of woodland critters discover a lost iPhone 17 Pro and use it to film themselves singing a song of friendship as a gift, before returning it to its rightful owner.'

 <p class="entry">And for anyone who wants to see the behind-the-scenes view, Apple released Apple Holiday | The Making of The Apple Holiday Film | Shot on iPhone 17 Pro. `Puppeteers dressed like blueberries. Individually placed whiskers. An entire forest built 3 feet off the ground. And so much more. 

Take a look behind the scenes of our new holiday film to see how we handcrafted a cast of woodland puppets 🦝 🐿️🐰🐀🐻🐺🦉🦌 and brought them to life on iPhone 17 Pro.`   Here it is:</p>

 <p class="entry"> <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music Complete Guide</a>, by Macrumors.  A nice, short overview. 

 </p>
 
 <p class="entry">Recall that recently, Apple released a web-based interface of Apple Music at  <a target=_top href="https://music.apple.com/us/new">music.apple.com</a>

 </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> Apple just released its 2025 Apple Music year-end charts, highlighting new global listening trends, expanded analytics, and several unexpected chart-topping performances across streaming, radio, lyrics, and Shazam activity,  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-music-shares-2025-charts/">reports MacRumors</a>

</p>

<p class="entry">Likewise, Apple Music subscribers get to see `Replay 2025' which gives you  a full year-end playlist containing the Apple Music songs that you listened to the most over the past year, as well as a Highlight Reel with images and a video that are designed to be shared on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.` Also,  This year, Apple says it has highlighted even more listening habits including, Discovery: New artists who captured your ears over the past year, Loyalty: Artists you've kept coming back to, year after year, Comebacks: Artists who made a return to your rotation. </p>
 
 
 
 <p class="entry">Apple announced  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/">John Giannandrea to retire from Apple</a>. `Apple today announced John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down from his position and will serve as an advisor to the company before retiring in the spring of 2026. Apple also announced that renowned AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya will be leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation. The balance of Giannandrea’s organization will shift to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue to align closer with similar organizations.'

 </p>
 
 
 <p class="entry"> <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">John Giannandrea Is Out</a>, reports John Gruber. `After the fiasco around Apple Intelligence and the “more personalized Siri” features — which were announced at WWDC in June 2024, but postponed until 2026 in a tail-between-their-legs announcement in March 2025 — and the executive reshuffling immediately after that delay was announced that put Mike Rockwell in charge of Siri and moved all or most of Apple Intelligence and Siri under Craig Federighi, it would have been much more surprising if Giannandrea had stayed at Apple. In fact, I’m surprised he wasn’t out before WWDC this past June. I don’t think we need to wait for additional details to know that he was squeezed out.'
