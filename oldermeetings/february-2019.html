<p class="entry">  Time Cook penned an essay in Time magazine,   <a target=_top href="http://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/">You Deserve Privacy Online. Here's How You Could Actually Get It</a>. He calls for federal privacy legislation and the creation of a `data-broker clearinghouse'. </p>


<p class="entry"> Tim Cook writes, `In 2019, it’s time to stand up for the right to privacy—yours, mine, all of ours. Consumers shouldn’t have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives.' </p>

<p class="entry"> Cook continues, `This problem is solvable—it isn’t too big, too challenging or too late. Innovation, breakthrough ideas and great features can go hand in hand with user privacy—and they must. Realizing technology’s potential depends on it.' </p>



<p class="entry">  Rene Ritchie of iMore, discusses privacy and Tim Cook's essay in this brief video: </p>

Among the reasons Apple is able to offer the XR at a cheaper price point is eschewing an OLED panel in favor of a more traditional LCD. In terms of the fundamentals of the LCD in the iPhone XR, Apple continues to employ some of the best panels in the industry, and the iPhone XR is no exception to this. Brightness, contrast ratio (for an LCD), viewing angles, and colour calibration are all top-notch and will not disappoint. Lasting 25% longer than the iPhone XS Max, it represents a major improvement in battery life and is going to make all the difference for users who value it above everything else. For those users, the cheaper iPhone XR may very well be the better choice.' </p>
