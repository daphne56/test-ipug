	<p class="entry"> Much has been discussed about Apple, Twitter, and Elon Musk.  There is a lot of noise about this. If you want a thoughtful discussion of the topic, Kara Swisher's interview of Yoel Roth, ex-executive from Twitter and chief of trust and safety is  worthwhile. Roth offers his perspective in a fair-minded and informative way.  Here it is:</p>
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-twitters-former-safety-chief-left-elon-musk/id1643307527?i=1000588297388">Why Twitter's Former Safety Chief Left Elon Musk</a>.  Description: "Elon Musk's Twitter is a spectacle, and the drama and meaning of the last six months is perhaps best unpacked by Yoel Roth. The company’s former head of trust and safety survived the early flood of firings and resignations — in fact, he was ascendant, in the early days of this new Twitter, and he became the face Musk presented to advertisers. Kara asks Roth whether he felt “used” by Musk and why — having been embraced by Elon’s inner circle — he ultimately decided to abandon Elon. 
Before the interview, Kara and Nayeema weigh in on Elon Musk’s seeming needling of Tim Cook, and they discuss whether Apple has too much power. Stay tuned until the end for Kara’s rant on this very topic."</p>

	<p class="entry"> The new  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Series 8 overview</a> by Macrumors provides highlights and details. </p>

<p class="entry"> Mary Anne gave her initial thoughts on the Series 8. </p>


<p class="entry">  Apple Watch Series 8 Review, by The Street:<a target=_top href="https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/apple-watch-series-8-review">Best-in-Class Smartwatch</a>. They praise the watch for all its capabilities and safety features. They note it's a more appealing upgrade from a Series 4, 5, or 6, less so for a 7 owner.</p>




<p class="entry"> Men's Health  <a target=_top href="https://www.menshealth.com/technology-gear/a41215472/apple-watch-series-8-se-review/">reviews Series 8</a>. They write: </p>

<p class="entry"> `The Series 8 is put in a bit of an awkward spot. Yes, the flashy new Ultra has the momentum going out of Apple’s rough and tumble presentation, but that doesn’t mean the Series 8 was just a second thought. I gave the Series 8 a wear test for a just under a week after the big reveal at the Keynote, and I found that consistency ruled with the new device.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Should you upgrade? If you want access to the most recent Apple tech, with its most powerful health sensors, safety features, and battery life, yes, especially if your current device is more than a few years old or you've never owned an Apple Watch. If you have an Apple Watch that's only one or two years old, however, you might want to sit this release out (or wait for the super-powered Ultra if its adventure specs are more appealing to you).' </p>

<p class="entry"> Read: <a target=_top href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2022/09/28/apple-watch-ultra-scotland/">Testing an Apple Watch Ultra</a> in the Scottish Highlands, by David Smith, iOS developer and avid hiker. He took it on a 50-mile hike and tested it over 3 days.  He took a regular Apple Watch along as well. His video review is chapterized and worth watching.  And watch his summary:</p>

<p class="entry"> Sometime later this fall, the Ultra will work  <a target=_top href="https://www.oceanicworldwide.com/oceanic-plus/?v=7516fd43adaa">with the 3rd party app Oceanic+</a>.  `The new Oceanic+ app for Apple Watch Ultra turns the watch you wear every day into a fully capable dive computer for recreational diving and snorkeling. It includes all the core features divers need, and is refreshingly easy to use.' This will require a subscription of $79/year. It will include all the dive-related functions offered by a  dive computer. Including: dive planning, water type, ascent warnings, safety stops, mixed gas options.
