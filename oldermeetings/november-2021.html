 <p class="entry"> Kara Swisher's Say episode interview of Walt Mossberg is a must-listen for all who are interested in technology, Apple, and more: </p>

<p class="entry"> `After leaked internal documents in The Wall Street Journal, whistle-blower testimony on Capitol Hill, a global server outage and drops in share price, Facebook has recently taken (another) spectacular beating. But the veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg says none of it has been a surprise. A longtime friend and mentor of Kara Swisher, he tells her, “I think the company is fundamentally unethical.” And, drawing on his experience covering controversial leaders, including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (as he calls them, “the old guard”), Mossberg says the Facebook C.E.O. is still an aberration: “In my encounters with Mark Zuckerberg, I’ve never been able to discover any principles.` </p>

<p class="topicTitle">tips & tricks</p>
	
	
	
<p class="entry"> Alexis shared a very nice tip:  `If you are ever lost while hiking, encounter a severe storm, or get stranded with a broken down car, etc and you notice your cell phone is getting low on juice, here is a tip that very well may save your life.  
Change the voicemail on your phone to a message that gives your approximate location, the time, the date, your situation (lost, out of gas, car broken down, injured, etc) and any special instructions such as you are staying with the car, you are walking toward a town, etc....  The best part of this is that even if your cell phone dies or stops working, voicemail still works, so anyone calling your phone looking for you will hear the message and know where to find you or where to send help.' </p>

<p class="entry"> It's worth noting that this applies to anyone and everyone, not only iOS users.  Naturally, it assumes that you have at least some access to cell service in order to modify and update your voice mail. </p>

<p class="entry"> If you are in a remote location where cell coverage is limited or spotty, another option is to send your location to at least one friend or family member.  This takes advantage of iOS features (iPhone or Appl Watch) and uses less data than a voicemail audio message. </p>

<p class="topicTitle">watch</p>
	
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/well/live/smartwatch-heart-rate-monitor.html">Can Apple Watch save your life?</a>, asks the Dr. Epstein, writing for the NY Times, reporting on his healthy 87-year old mother who got a recommendation: `call your doctor'. This led to a life-saving heart surgery.  The article is also filled with many reader comments reporting how Apple Watch helped them.</p>

<p class="entry"> Some examples from readers comments: </p>

<p class="entry"> `As a practicing Cardiologist who sees 150 patients a week, I routinely recommend the Apple Watch to patients with palpitations in whom a cause cannot be found with routine monitoring. The monitors can only be used for 28 days and people frequently do not have symptoms during the monitoring period. The ECG obtained on the Apple Watch are generally of excellent quality and the patient can email me a PDF of an abnormal recording.' </p>

<p class="entry"> `Yes, my Apple watch saved my life. Not by the cardiac monitor, but by its fall detection. My watch is an extension of my phone (an extra $10 a month). When I missed my step and fell from a friend's porch onto the sidewalk, I struck my head and lost consciousness. 

My Apple watch detected the fall, and when I didn't respond it notified my emergency contacts and called an ambulance. When I regained consciousness my friend was still wondering what to do and the ambulance was already pulling up. By the time I got to the ER my family was also en route. 

I survived a serious head injury that can disable and kill. It's been a hard year for all of us but I feel blessed to have regained what I'd lost, to be alive and walking and able to care for myself in my own home. I am forever grateful to Apple and the world of people who cross my path every day.` </p>

<p class="entry"> `Three years ago the Apple Watch detected a serious congenital heart condition in my then 31 year old sister. The doctors said she needed surgery quite urgently and according to them the Apple Watch saved her life. It may be worth for a bunch to go through extra testing If it eases their mind so that a few can be saved.` </p>

<p class="entry"> `As a 60 year old, avid horse person - who has 14 horses on our breeding farm.  I recently got hit in the face by a young colt who reared up. which knocked out and broke teeth. I did not go down, but took a good knock to the head.  My iphone watch with cellular, immediately asked if 911 needed to be called.
Not the first time, I have taken a fall and had it ask to call 911.  This thing is a lifesaver for those of us in dangerous sports and professions.' </p>





<p class="entry"> `As a former endurance sports person with a Fitbit, I found it useful for watching fluctuations in resting heart rate as an over training indicator and still do as I push 60 years old. My rate these days is mid-50s but drops into the 40s at night. I can easily tell if I had an extra glass of wine or too much caffeine, as my rate goes into the 60s. For almost a year, I was experiencing shortness of breath when I exercised, but my resting rate was only slightly elevated, still under 60...I finally went to the doc, got ekg and stress test...all normal. What I didn’t mention to them was I was experiencing calf pain and tightness, a muscle pull (I thought) that wouldn’t go away...well recently, my resting rate went into the mid 60s, I could see it going up daily over a week pushing close to 70...the leg pain got worst along with it, and my shortness of breath got worst where I could hardly walk up stairs. Reading online, these were symptoms of a DVT and pulmonary embolism so went to emergency room...yes, they confirmed I had a major clot in the leg. Now I’m on blood thinners, everything is back to normal. I’m a believer in these devices, it was the additional data that convinced me to go to the emergency room.' </p>

<p class="entry"> `I was felled by a stroke (later neutralized) and absent an Apple watch had no way of seeking help. This watch sends out an alarm and location. Astounded this wasn’t mentioned in the piece.'` </p>

<p class="entry"> `I'm very grateful for my Apple Watch. I’ve had occasional heart arrhythmia for my whole life but last year it seemed to be getting significantly worse. I contacted my doctor who ordered in-office EKG, echocardiogram and 24 hour holter monitor. All showed nothing. Then I had some arrhythmic episodes at home and while out exercising and managed to record them with my watch. I sent the results to my doctor who said they clearly showed episodes of afib. Easily managed with a fairly low dose of medication, it’s now a non-issue for me.` </p>

<p class="entry"> `The Apple Watch saved my life!
I tripped while walking in the early morning with no one nearby, knocked myself unconscious, bleeding heavily from face wounds.
I woke in an ambulance and asked the EMTs what happened. They told me my watch called 911, gave my location. They said I would have died from blood loss if I hadn't been wearing the watch.` </p>
