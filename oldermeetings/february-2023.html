<p class="entry"> The HomePod 2 looks very similar to the original but Apple has come up with a more repairable design. The new version does not have as much glue and it is easier to open it up. </p>

<p class="entry"> Both HomePod mini and the new HomePod have a temperature and humidity sensor, and you can ask about the temperature and humidity in the rooms where you have placed them.  You can ask `Hey Siri, what‚Äôs the temperature in the kitchen? or `Hey Siri, what‚Äôs the humidity in the living room?' </p>

<p class="entry"> If you are looking for password managers,  <a target=_top href="https://support.1password.com/explore/get-started/">1Password</a> is a very good one and many Mac and iPhone users rely on it.  However, they have recently changed their business model to subscription-based, have expanded to include Android and Windows, which has led them to use different technology and APIs, slowing down performance. They are also focusing more on enterprise customers. And the Safari plug-in does not work as seamlessly.  These may be reasons to consider switching to Apple's own iCloud Keychain. </p>

<p class="entry">  If you want to consider or migrate to iCloud Keychain, you are in luck.  1Password can export individual entries or the whole database in a CSV format that iCloud Keychain can read and import.  Olga discussed this option. </p>

Skip the intro banter, the interview starts at min 10:37 and it's worth listening to it. 
	From the episode description: `Kara dives into a conversation about the present and future of tech with a person who‚Äôs been around Silicon Valley for decades: engineer and designer Tony Fadell. The ‚Äúfather of the iPod,‚Äù as he‚Äôs known, helped bring the famous 5,000 songs to your pocket before helping design the iPhone, co-founding Nest ( selling it to Google for $3.2 billion) and writing the bestselling book, ‚ÄúBuild: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making.‚Äù These days, he is bullish on climate tech and excited about the newest product he's designed: Stax, a crypto hard wallet.¬†
Kara and Tony trade notes on Silicon Valley, including why Apple should think beyond four-wheel cars, why Google struggles to innovate (coddling employees is part of it) and how the next Fortune 500 companies will be the ones who help solve climate change."</p>

<p class="entry"> If you have misplaced your iPhone nearby, the quickest way to locate it is to use your Apple Watch to make it beep: On your Watch,  swipe up to go to Control Center and tap the iPhone icon.  But did you know there is another feature?  You can tap and hold that same icon.  This maes your iPhone beep and flash a bright light at the same time.  Very handy in the dark.</p>

	<p class="entry">  A reminder that all recent models of Apple Watch  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210931">have a water locking/expelling feature</a>. </p>
