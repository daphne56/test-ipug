You get to prepare before you leave (typically a few days before) and it helps you manage and adjust in an optimal way.  Astronauts use it, airline employees use it, and many more.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Kara Swisher's podcast episode <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-with-kara-swisher/id1643307527?i=1000648332776">Why Reed Jobs is Betting on Cancer Innovations</a> is her interview with Reed Jobs, son of Steve Jobs. `In high school, Reed Jobs was a summer intern in oncology labs while his dad, the late Apple co-founder and tech icon Steve Jobs, was battling pancreatic cancer. In his biography, Steve is quoted as calling his son’s interest in biotech the “silver lining” of his illness – and making cancer “non-lethal” has become Reed’s life mission. In 2023, he spun off the venture capital firm Yosemite from Emerson Collective (the philanthropy and family office founded by his mother, Laurene Powell Jobs) to focus on cancer research and biotech. Kara and Reed talk about the research-to-start up pipeline, how he’s been influenced by both of his parents, and whether AI, mRNA or CRISPR will be game changers for cancer patients.' </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.lostwomenofscience.org">Lost Women of Science</a> is a podcast that spotlights the many women of science whose names remain unknown to the public at large.   The podcast spotlights a scientist and `also brings these stories to the present, painting a full picture of how her work endures.'</p>

<p class="entry"> For example, a recent podcast episode: </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-universe-in-radio-vision/id1590670779?i=1000644600105">The Universe in Radio Vision</a>, spotlights `the start of radio astronomy', the Australian physicist Ruby Payne-Scott, who helped lay the groundwork for a whole new kind of astronomy: radio astronomy. `By scanning the skies for radio waves instead of the light waves we can see with our eyes, Ruby and her colleagues opened a window into the universe and transformed the way we explore it. But to keep her job as a woman working for the Australian government in the 1940s, Ruby had to keep a pretty big secret.' </p>

It's great for traveling. Bernie reported being very happy with this.</p>

<p class="entry"> Olga reported getting the 2nd generation of  <a target=_top href="https://paperlike.com">Paperlike</a> screen protector for her iPad. Her goal was not so much to protect the screen, but primarily to try out the `paper-like' feeling that this offers.  It is intended to add a very slight increase in pencil friction to mimic writing on paper, not on glass.  It does not cut down on the screen's brightness or viewing pleasure when you are watching a movie, for example.  It's intended to improve the writing and drawing experience.  Olga reported liking this, she has been using it for a month.  The careful application instructions are impressive too, helping you avoid dust particles when you apply the screen protector. Take a look: </p>

<p class="topicTitle">AI </p>
	
	
	
<p class="entry"> Podcast host Preet Bharara has recently released a mini-series of 3 podcast episodes on AI and its implications for society, as seen from a legal angle.  The goal is to describe to what degree our current laws are (and are not) ready to deal with the possible hypotheticals that can arise with AI used in a medical setting, in politics, .   He is joined by  Nita Farahany, professor of law and philosophy at Duke University, and author of the book `The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology.'   </p>
 
 
 <p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stay-tuned-with-preet/id1265845136?i=1000647906766">Al on Trial: Bot-Crossed Lovers</a> is the first episode pf the AI miniseries. Preet and Nita discuss the hypothetical case of a nurse who is caught stealing medications and redistributing them to people living in poverty. As it turns out, an artificial intelligence chatbot, who the nurse is in love with, aided her crimes and coerced her into carrying them out. How might the AI’s assistance impact the nurse’s criminal liability and a potential prosecution? And how do we even begin to think about the idea of holding the AI itself accountable for the harm it causes? </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stay-tuned-with-preet/id1265845136?i=1000648732418">Al on Trial: Deepfakes v. Democracy</a> is the 2nd episode of the miniseries. Preet and Nita discuss the hypothetical case of a hotly-contested Senate race. The campaigns are derailed when the leading candidate is accused of using AI to create fake videos that burnish his performance and hurt his opponent. Do existing laws, policies, and government agencies sufficiently safeguard our political process, and if not, what needs to happen to protect democracy in time for the real presidential election in November?</p>
 
 <p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stay-tuned-with-preet/id1265845136?i=1000649547085">Al on Trial: Bot Bharara Steals Stay Tuned</a> is the 3rd and final episode of the miniseries. Preet and Nita discuss the hypothetical case of an artificial intelligence chatbot that impersonates Preet as the host of a copycat podcast, Stay Tuned with Bot Bharara. The unauthorized chatbot was trained on everything Preet has ever said or written online. Can Preet protect his intellectual property rights? Is the law on the real Preet’s side, or is it time to surrender to an AI-dominated world and collaborate with the bot?</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1242019127/google-incognito-mode-settlement-search-history">Google to delete search data of millions who used 'incognito' mode</a>, reports NPR. `Google will destroy the private browsing history of millions of people who used “incognito” mode in its Chrome browser as a part of a settlement filed to federal court on Monday in a case over the company’s secret tracking of web activity. For years, Google simply informed users of Chrome’s internet browser that “you’ve gone Incognito” and “now you can browse privately,” when the supposedly untraceable browsing option was turned on — without saying what bits of data the company has been harvesting. [  . . . ] Yet, according to a 2020 class-action lawsuit, the tech giant continued to scrape searches by hoovering up data about users who browsed the internet in incognito mode through advertising tools used by websites, grabbing “potentially embarrassing” searches of millions of people. Google then used this data to measure web traffic and sell ads.' </p>

Perhaps we need to do panels or write custom software. You should figure out how to do this.” Facebook’s engineers solution was to use Onavo, a VPN-like service that Facebook acquired in 2013. In 2019, Facebook shut down Onavo after a TechCrunch investigation revealed that Facebook had been secretly paying teenagers to use Onavo so the company could access all of their web activity.'</p>
