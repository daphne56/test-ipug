Thanks to iPhone satellite emergency call feature,  authorities were notified and rescued them. `Mr. Zelada looked for Ms. Fields’s cellphone and found it about 10 yards from their car, with the screen smashed. Even though there was no cell service, the phone had detected that there had been a crash, Ms. Fields said. Her iPhone 14 gave her a prompt to contact emergency services through a new feature called Emergency SOS via satellite.'</p>
	
	
	
	<p class="entry"> California rescuers say <a target=_top href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/california-rescuers-find-my-iphone-feature-save-woman-plummet"> 'Find my iPhone' feature helped save woman after 200-ft. plummet</a>. Apple's "Find My iPhone" feature aided in the rescue of a woman who had crashed her vehicle following a traffic collision in Southern California. `“The patient had likely been in her crashed vehicle overnight after leaving a family gathering. Family members became concerned after not speaking with her this morning and utilized Apple’s “Find my iPhone” feature to track her whereabouts. Upon investigating the phone’s location they found the vehicle over the side [and] called 911,” the department said.  </p>

	<p class="entry"> Olga recounted a recent experience with one of her 2 AirPods Pro that fell inside a crevasse on the side of an Air Canada airplane seat. Find My was helpful in confirming while they were separated after she disembarked from the plane, and the airline was very helpful in fishing it out and bringing it to the gate of her connecting flight. </p>

It's  recording of Kara’s September 2022 conversation with Tim Cook, Sir Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs on the life and legacy of Steve Jobs. Description: `It’s one of Kara’s favorite conversations of the year, and one in which she cried (though she denies it).
Kara handpicked this trio to join her for her final Code interview. Cook, the CEO of Apple, worked with Jobs for decades and succeeded him as CEO. Ive, now co-founder of the creative collective LoveFrom, collaborated with Jobs on the design many of Apple’s game-changing products, like the iPod and the iPhone. And Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson Collective, was married to Jobs for 20 years. In this wide-ranging conversation, they cover design, ethics and, of course, Kara’s favorite topic: death.'  </p>
