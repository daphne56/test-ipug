<p class="entry">  Happy new year!  May 2021 be brighter for all. Meanwhile, we will continue our Zoom-based iPUG meetings until it is safe to gather in person and indoors.  Based on current events, it will likely require several months.</p>

<p class="entry"> Meanwhile, our tried-and-true gathering spot Fronimos has just announced  <a target=_top href="https://www.fronimos.com">they are closing their Speedway location</a>, due to `astronomical rent increase' by the landlord.  Hopefully they will be able to reopen in another location soon. </p>

She said she was chronically overlooked, scorned, fired, demoted, repeatedly refused government and corporate grants, and threatened with deportation — among other indignities, ' they report. But now, `Scientists say they couldn’t have won the global vaccine race without her.' </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 14</p>

<p class="entry"> An overview of iOS 14.3 that was released just before the holidays, including:  support for AirPods Max, Apple Fitness+, new playlist full bleed animated headers, updated Apple News Audio, new Set Wallpaper action in Shortcuts, People Detection, and much more. Watch this video for more details:</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pN8dyHMHk1Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>


<p class="entry"> With iOS 14.3, you can ask Siri bout sounds.  For example, you can ask:

“Hey Siri, what does a humpback whale sound like?”;
“Hey Siri, what does a toy poodle sound like?;
“Hey Siri, what does a harp sound like?”;
“Hey Siri, what do firetrucks sound like?” </p>







<p class="topicTitle">AirPods Max </p>


<p class="entry">  Last month, Apple released the new AirPods Max headphone.  Here is an excellent video review by Marques Brownlee (12 mins): </p>


<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gvvo6vUpJRc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry">  He gives them a very high rating, he calls them `luxury listening'.  The noise cancellation is excellent (cancelled the noise fro a vacuum cleaner 3 feet away) and concludes that they `should be great on a plane.’  Note that to cancel noise, these headphones have 8 microphones.  He also says they have the best Transparency mode he’s ever heard: you can hear where an ambient noise is coming from, unlike with other headphones. The sound is excellent, with good musical instrument separation.  However, he dislikes the case: the design of it, the fact that it does not cover the top, the way it opens/closes.  Note that this case is what is required to turn the headphones on/off.   The headphones have smart features (similar to Airpods Pro): they automatically pause audio when you take them off, Siri will read your text messages for you as they come in, if you want, they pair with every Apple device you have instantly, and more. </p>


<p class="entry"> This is a very clever demo of the AirPod Max headphones.  This setup is designed to accommodate headphones so you get to hear what you would hear if you were actually wearing the headphones:</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSb_y4TBMYk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> And this is an excellent review / overview of the airPods max by an audiophile.  He gives them very high marks.  He also notes that they are better than the competition but 90% more expensive.  This review  is  full of interesting tidbits. Watch: </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vb98s41__Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry">  And finally, here is a fun video that starts with unboxing and then gives a review.  It is very informative but also quite entertaining (caveat: some expletives!). He concludes that these are his new favorite headphones and worth the price. </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OS_MLnaqGk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> There have been some early misstatements by tech reviewers regarding the AirPod Max reliance on the case to go into power saving mode.  Apple  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886">clarified the various power saving modes</a>: If you take the headphones off and set them down, they will go into low power  mode after 5 minutes, or if you put them in their Smart case, they will go into lower power  mode immediately. The smart case is not required to trigger power-saving modes, it only accelerates their start. The headphones have a 20-hour battery life. </p>

<p class="entry"> So the smart case the headphones come with is not really required for the power saving mode. </p>

<p class="entry">  Waterfield  <a target=_top href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/airpods-max-shield-case">now offers a case for AirPods Max</a> that triggers the power saving mode immediately: </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> Fitness+ </p>


<p class="entry"> Comparing  <a target=_top href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/reviews/apple-fitness-cycling-review-vs-peloton-vs-zwift/">Apple Fitness+ Cycling Review vs Peloton vs Zwift</a> for cycling specifically. This Canadian reviewer concludes that Fitness+ is her favorite cycling workout.  It's also priced lowest. </p>


<p class="entry"> Fitness+ covers much more than cycling.  For a broader overview, take a look at this demo and review.  It shows Fitness+ in action. She walks us through the Fitness+ setup and interface, then walks through a few sessions and gives a sense of what Fitness+ is like.  She also points out features such as the accommodation for hearing disabilities, the burn bar, and that every video features 3 different instructors, each working out at a different difficulty level.
