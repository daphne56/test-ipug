 <p class="entry"> iOS 13.7 has been released  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/apple-releases-ios-13-7/">and it includes support for Exposure Notifications Express</a>. The Express Option  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/apple-ios-13-7-exposure-notification-express/">does not require an app</a>.</p>
 
 <p class="entry"> From Apple and Google’s announcement today: </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> `As the next step in our work with public health authorities on Exposure Notifications, we are making it easier and faster for them to use the Exposure Notifications System without the need for them to build and maintain an app. Exposure Notifications Express provides another option for public health authorities to supplement their existing contact tracing operations with technology without compromising on the project's core tenets of user privacy and security. Existing apps using the ‌Exposure Notification‌ API will be compatible with Exposure Notifications Express, and we are committed to supporting public health authorities that have deployed or are building custom apps.` </p>
 
 
 <p class="entry"> More evidence by scientists that Covid-19 is aerosolized:  <a target=_top href="https://time.com/5883081/covid-19-transmitted-aerosols/">COVID-19 Is Transmitted Through Aerosols. We Have Enough Evidence, Now It Is Time to Act</a>, an overview published by Time Magazine.  The author is  a Professor of Chemistry and a Fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder and a Fellow of the American Association for Aerosol Research and the American Geophysical Union.  He gives a thorough overview of the topic.  He has been joined by 239 other scientists in a letter to the WHO to amend their recommendations.  He likens aerosols to smoke from a cigarette: it lingers in an area for a little while and those who walk through it and breathe are exposed even if they observe social-distancing recommendations.</p>

Anyone in Arizona can use it.  `Let your smartphone notify you to potential exposure to COVID-19–using fully anonymous Bluetooth signals–and help stop the spread of coronavirus in Arizona.’  The app is developed in partnership with the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS).’   The app uses the Apple/Google API for exposure notification while maintaining privacy and anonymity.</p>

<p class="entry"> Olga reported using the app since Aug 19.  On Aug 31, she received a notification.  Here are screenshots: </p>

 <p class="entry"> Finally, the app has some info and FAQ links.  It still seems to be in development overall, they probably tried to get it out the door as UA classes were starting.  It will probably include more relevant descriptions over time. Still, its main function works.  Olga concluded that Covid-19 is definitely spread in the Tucson community.</p>
