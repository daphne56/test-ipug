<p class="entry"> An in-depth look at    <a target=_top href="https://www.executivetraveller.com/news/review-apple-airtag-for-tracking-airline-luggage-and-checked-baggage">traveling with a suitcase with an AirTag attached</a> by Executive Traveler. A lot of useful info. Some highlights:</p>

<p class="entry"> A). `While airlines have banned rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs from checked luggage (including so-called ‘smart luggage’), this doesn’t apply to the tiny single-use lithium CR2023 cells. ' </p>

<p class="entry"> B). `The first issue is that the AirTag’s live here-I-am tracking isn’t intended for objects that are moving, unless they’re doing so at the most leisurely pace.
And while the average airport luggage belt is no threat to Usain Bolt, it runs too fast for the AirTag’s virtual hand-waving to be properly identified by your iPhone.' </p>

<p class="entry"> C). `Even with an iPhone 12 to take advantage of Precision Finding, the only time the AirTagged bag appeared on my screen while being carried along the belt was when it was literally right in front of me.' </p>


<p class="entry"> D). `AirTags have a clear application to help find anything you might travel with but also risk leaving behind or losing: your passport wallet, a briefcase or jacket, even the carry case where your noise-cancelling headphones reside when not in use (there’s a reason noise-cancelling cans are among the most numerous items when airports auction off their lost property).' </p>

<p class="entry"> E). `Putting the AirTag inside the bag instead of on the external strap made no discernible difference to the range or accuracy of tracking.' </p>


<p class="entry"> And of course, iFixIt  has done it:<a target=_top href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks">AirTag Teardown</a>.  It shows you an AirTag in 360 degree X-ray and where to drill a hole safely, if you are inclined to attach it directly to a lanyard or similar, instead of getting a case for it. </p>

<p class="entry"> Finally,  <a target=_top href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/25/compared-apple-airtag-vs-tile-pro-and-chipolo-one-spot?utm_medium=rss">Apple AirTag vs Tile Pro and Chipolo One Spot</a> compares all 3 options and their features.  With Ultra-Wideband and Precision Finding, plus better integration with Apple's ecosystem, AirTags have the advantage. </p>


<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 14.5</p>

<p class="entry"> Yes, we finally got iOS 14.5!   Here is  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/ios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more/">Apple's official announcement</a>.</p>
