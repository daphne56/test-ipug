<p class="entry"> 30 years ago,  <a target=_top href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary">one decision altered the course of our connected world</a>, NPR reports. `On April 30, 1993, something called the World Wide Web launched into the public domain.' [ . . . ] `"Imagine being able to communicate at-will with 10 million people all over the world," NPR's Neal Conan said. "Imagine having direct access to catalogs of hundreds of libraries as well as the most up-to-date news, business and weather reports. Imagine being able to get medical advice or gardening advice immediately from any number of experts.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `The World Wide Web was the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, a 37-year-old researcher at a physics lab in Switzerland called CERN. The institution is known today for its massive particle accelerators. CERN owned Berners-Lee's invention, and the lab had the option to license out the World Wide Web for profit. But Berners-Lee believed that keeping the web as open as possible would help it grow. Berners-Lee eventually convinced CERN to release the World Wide Web into the public domain without any patents or fees. He has since attributed the runaway success of the web to that single decision.' </p>

<p class="entry"> The World Wide Web uses the  <a target=_top href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> which is even older and  whose origins date back to the 1960's from the US Dept of Defense. </p>
