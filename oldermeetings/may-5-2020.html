<p class="topicTitle"> COVID-19 related</p>


<p class="entry"> What will it take to reopen the US economy and society?   <a target=_top href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/covid-roadmap">Harvard University offers a Roadmap to Pandemic resilience</a>. `Our bipartisan group of experts in economics, public health, technology, and ethics from across the country, with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, has released the nation’s first comprehensive operational roadmap for mobilizing and reopening the U.S. economy in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis.’  </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) It comes down to 3 main components: Testing, Tracing, and Supported Isolation.  This group of experts says it’s not a choice between on-going economic anguish or accelerating widespread death. The way out is through massively increased Testing, Tracing, and Supported Isolation.</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) It would take 5 million tests a day by June, 20 million a day by July. It would take a national production board, and/or an interstate compact, to distribute the tests. It would mean enlisting at least 100,000 Americans to help with contact tracing. And it would require leadership to orchestrate all this. </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) This will require investment, but it’s a bargain compared with continued collective quarantine (or risky reopening without adequate testing/tracing/supported isolation). We’ll have to mobilize in a way similar to WWII. </p>

<p class="entry"> See more supporting materials like in-depth papers on different aspects:  <a target=_top href="https://www.pandemictesting.org/ ">PandemicTesting.org</a>.</p>

<p class="entry"> Tim Cook delivers Ohio State Commencement Address, on Sunday, May 3, 2020.  He offered a perspective from history, how the Spanish Flu affected Amelia Earhart, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and poet T.S. Elliot and how they overcame adversity and thrived.  He advised graduates to “build a better future than the one you thought was certain”.  </p>


<p class="entry"> (cont’d) Cook added, "Most of all, think about how you — blessed with a world-class education — might act and work and be different when all of this is said and done. Memorialize in your heart the way in which these times reveal what really matters: the health and well being of our loved ones, the resilience of our communities, and the sacrifices made by those — from doctors to garbage collectors — who give their whole selves to serving others.’’  </p>

<p class="entry"> Listen to a very interesting interview of  Jeffrey Katzenberg: <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+QLdvuZ7CQ">It’s not TV (or HBO, or Netflix). It’s Quibi.</a>.  Podcast synopsis: `Quibi founder Jeffrey Katzenberg talks with Recode's Kara Swisher about the first week of the short-form video app — which was intended for on-the-go consumers, but still racked up 1.7 million downloads, even though most of the world is currently staying at home. Katzenberg makes the case for short video episodes as a logical next step for entertainment, and explains how the economics of producing shows such as Dishmantled and Chrissy's Court compares to Netflix, traditional TV and YouTube. He also explains why he's not worried about skepticism from TV purists, why he desperately wanted former eBay and HP CEO Meg Whitman to lead Quibi, and how the platform is attracting top talent from across Hollywood and the broader entertainment business to make shows.’  </p>
