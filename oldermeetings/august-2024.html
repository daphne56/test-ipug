Now, users can get driving and walking directions; find great places and useful information including photos, hours, ratings, and reviews; take actions like ordering food directly from the Maps place card; and browse curated Guides to discover places to eat, shop, and explore in cities around the world. Additional features, including Look Around, will be available in the coming months.'

<p class="entry"> With further analysis, Jason Snell notes  <a target=_top href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/08/existential-thoughts-about-apples-reliance-on-services-revenue/">Apple’s Profits From Services Are on the Cusp of Surpassing Its Profits From Device Sales</a>. `This is what was buzzing in the back of my head as I was going over all the numbers on Thursday. We’re not quite there yet, but it’s hard to imagine that there won’t be a quarter in the next year or so in which Apple reports more total profit on Services than on products.

When that happens, is Apple still a products company? Or has it crossed some invisible line?'

On your iOS device, start a new Note, then tap the camera, and select Scan Documents. Similarly, on your Mac, in the Notes app, you can click on Scan Documents and it will connect to your iPhone which you can use to take a photo.  Either way, it's fast and efficient.  </p>

 </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> This is how massive this was: `The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company revealed Friday. AT&T said the compromised data includes the telephone numbers of “nearly all” of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that use its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022.

The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted — including customers of other wireless networks — the number of times they interacted, and the call duration.

Importantly, AT&T said the stolen data did not include the contents of calls and text messages nor the time of those communications.' </p>
