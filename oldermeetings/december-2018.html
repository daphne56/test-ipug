<p class="entry"> Do you have 3rd party iOS app that asks you to access your Contacts or Photos or other data?  It’s a good idea to be very conservative and only grant access if you think it’s absolutely necessary.  But what if you do not agree that an app needs access and yet the app requires access to, say, your Contacts, and you `must’ use it?  Is there a workaround? In many cases, the answer is yes. Olga recently had to use  <a target=_top href="https://www.viber.com">Viber</a> to communicate with someone who only knows Viber (on an Android no less!). However, Viber will not operate without access to Contacts. So, Olga temporarily logged out of iCloud on her iPhone and removed all her contacts. Then, she temporarily created a single contact entry in her iPhone (the person she needed to communicate with). She then enabled Viber. Once the communication was established, Olga rescinded access to Contacts to Viber, and logged back into iCloud. Viber (apparently) does not check whether access to a user’s Contacts continues after initial install, so Olga can continue the communication via Viber without problems and without ever giving real access to her Contacts database.  (Anyone who is curious about  <a target=_top href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viber">company info on Wikipedia</a>.)  </p>

Jon Callas is expected to help the ACLU resist governments demanding access to company platforms for surveillance of users and to weigh in on issues including fairness and transparency in artificial intelligence. Commenting on this story, Bruce Schneier,  a famous cryptography expect, said, `Discrimination in the 21st century is algorithmic. Free-speech abuses in the 21st century are about platforms. It is no longer the case that these worlds are separate.`</p>
