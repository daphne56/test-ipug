<p class="topicTitle">Apple child protection announcements </p>


<p class="entry">  Last month, we did not get to hold an iPUG meeting and that was almost exactly the time when Apple dropped a proverbial bomb and announced new child protection features that caused approximately 300 thousand earthquakes in the tech community.  So we have some catching up to do. Here is a very brief overview of the aftershocks that ensued.</p>


<p class="entry"> What happened?! </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple announced 2 new features coming with iOS 15.  One feature is to help identify anyone who uses Apple's iCloud servers to store previously-known photographs of CSAM content. (CSAM = Child Sexual Abuse Material).</p>

<p class="entry"> Apple's 2nd feature is to help curb the so-called `grooming' of underage children by potential sexual predators, where nude or sexually explicit photos graphs are sent to children via the Messages app. To do so, Apple announced  that it will use AI to automatically `recognize' and blur such images and offer the child the chance to skip viewing this or to tap to view.  If the child chooses to view, the parent will be notified.  (This feature is ONLY available to family accounts with parents choosing to enable it.)</p>

<p class="entry"> Here is Apple's description of <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">Expanded Protections for Children</a>. This page also includes papers by researchers in encryption, security and privacy, stating that Apple's unique solutions protect privacy and security.</p>



<p class="entry"> And then a lot of commentators got it wrong, some got it right, and many were upset and very disturbed at the seeming loss of privacy protections, despite Apple's good intentions. </p>

<p class="entry">  Not all commentators got it wrong, however, and many prominent ones have been very vocal about slippery-slope concerns, unintended security and privacy holes, and other potential dangers. </p>


<p class="entry">  The Electronic Frontier Foundation voiced a lot of valid concerns.  </p>

<p class="entry">  Joanna Stern of the WSJ  <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-child-protection-features-11628861782?mod=followjoannastern">interviewed Apple's Creg Federighi</a> on the new features. This is worth watching (11 mins):</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="512" height="288" src="https://video-api.wsj.com/api-video/player/v3/iframe.html?guid=573D76B3-5ACF-4C87-ACE1-E99CECEFA82C"></iframe> </p>




<p class="entry"> Here is a (40-minute) overview with sensible commentary from Rene Ritchie:) </p>


<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dq_hvJI76IY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> Here are some  <a target=_top href="https://blog.roboflow.com/neuralhash-collision/">technical concerns</a>, with portions of Apple's design.</p>


<p class="entry"> Then, last Friday (Sept 3, 2021), Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-delay-iphone-update-that-could-scan-device-for-illegal-content-11630676309?mod=followjoannastern"> announced it will delay the rollout </a> of these two features, as they have become very controversial, the WSJ reports. `We have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.'</p>


<p class="entry">  The Electronic Frontier Foundation  said it is `pleased' Apple is delaying these features and now pressures Apple by posting: <a target=_top href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/delays-arent-good-enough-apple-must-abandon-its-surveillance-plans">Delays Aren't Good Enough‚ÄîApple Must Abandon Its Surveillance Plans</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Nobody is in favor of child exploitation, of course.  The concerns have to do with Apple opening a back-door that cannot be secured. It `would lead to the censoring of protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world,' argues the EFF. </p>





<p class="entry">  A little more on this topic which will not likely go away soon: </p>

<p class="entry"> Kara Swisher's Sway podcast released its latest episode with a focus on Thorn, a non-profit organization whose aim is to stop online child sexual exploitation. Here is  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-ashton-kutcher-and-julie-cordua-are-defending-apple/id1528594034?i=1000534085150">the podcast on Apple's Podcast app</a> and here is   <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+m_roHFlMo">the Overcast podcast link</a>.      The podcast is an interview of `Ashton Kutcher and Julie Cordua discuss Apple‚Äôs new tools to fight the sexual exploitation of young people online and what the trade-off might be for privacy'. Julie Cordua is the Thorn‚Äôs CEO, and Ashton Kutcher co-founded Thorn with his then-wife Demi Moore.   </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is a quote from the interview: </p>

<p class="entry">`The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children revealed that its cyber tip line had 21.7 million incidents of C.S.A.M. in 2020. That‚Äôs an increase of 28 percent from 2019. Much of the material didn‚Äôt come from porn sites, but from Facebook. Facebook accounted for about 95 percent of reports across all platforms. Was that a surprise to you?'  </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is the entire <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-julie-cordua-ashton-kutcher.html?showTranscript=1">the podcast transcript</a>. </p>
