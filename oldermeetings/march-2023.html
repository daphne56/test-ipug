Samsung’s share of this age group slipped to 44% from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For all older age groups, Samsung phones remain most prevalent.  [ .  . . ] Sarah Carrivale, a 24-year-old graduate student living in Paris, has noticed that more people around her age are using iPhones—around 7 in 10 she estimates. [ . . .  ] Across Western Europe, Android users under the age of 25 were almost three times more likely to prefer Apple for their next smartphone than older age groups, according to a poll last year by Canalys of 4,000 individuals from the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. </p>









<p class="topicTitle">iOS apps</p>
	
	


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://mymind.com">MyMind</a> is an app that describes itself as `Remember Everything, Organize Nothing.`  It uses AI to tag and categorize your entries automatically, you do not need to do anything.  It's easily and nicely implemented. Additionally, by design, it keeps all your data private.  Nothing is shared with anyone. (And as a result the app does not make money from ads or selling your data or behaviors to others.  It charges the user a  <a target=_top href="https://mymind.com/pricing">monthly or annual fee</a>.) Olga is trying this app and showed examples of how it tags entries automatically.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.turnsignl.com">TurnSignl</a> is now available in Arizona.  Recall that this is a service that provides you with a live attorney if you are driving and get pulled over by Police.  The attorney helps protect your rights, follow the law, all while de-escalating any situation. The interaction is automatically videoed while you have the app engaged. Pricing:  <a target=_top href="https://www.turnsignl.com/plans">free for a year, then $60/year</a>, for individuals.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://agiletortoise.com/tally/">Tally</a> is an iOS app to help you track any count you want.

<p class="entry">  In recent months, we have seen stories about how malicious people can try to stak someone using AirTags.  Apple has the mechanism in place to alert you if you are being followed by an unknown AirTag, but only after a this continues for a while.  The Kickstarter project <a target=_top href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1458746827/bluesleuth-lite-detect-hidden-airtags">`BlueSleuth-Lite - Detect hidden AirTags'</a> is a Kickstarter gadget designed  to detect nearby AirTags and alert you immediately.</p>

<p class="entry"> Olga mentioned the  <a target=_top href="https://www.belkin.com/smart-video-doorbell/WDC010.html">Wemo smart video doorbell</a> she bought last summer. It's a very nice doorbell/camera combination and it works well with iOS. However, it started requiring frequent resets recently, and eventually stopped working; Belkin support was a very good experience, they did troubleshooting over the phone and determined the doorbell went bad.  They sent a new one (free of charge).  Olga will share updates on the new doorbell over the coming months.</p>

<p class="entry"> Apple released  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-releases-new-apple-watch-bands/">new watch bands</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Feeling a bit too addicted to your iPhone?  There is a new trend to reply on an Apple Watch about 90% of the time.  This can help cut down on excess use of games or social media, while remaining productive with the majority of more productive type of tasks (texting, mail, calendar, payments, maps, various trackers, and so on). </p>


<p class="entry"> Apple announced  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/02/with-apple-watch-researchers-explore-new-frontiers-in-heart-health/">Apple Watch program to help medical research</a>. `Apple launched the Investigator Support Program which provides researchers with Apple Watch devices, enabling them to break new ground in health research, including the scientific understanding of the heart.'  Apple offers examples of several different medical research programs. </p>

<p class="entry">  (cont'd) `From Apple Watch, [a] study plans to monitor heart rate and rhythm, sleep, blood oxygen, activity data, and more. Firefighters will also wear an air quality monitor and complete surveys related to sleep, activity, and wildfire smoke-related symptoms. “Firefighters are bound to benefit from the study,” Dr. Cheong shares. “We know wildfire smoke directly affects their health and with a study like this, they’ll be able to see their results in real time.”'</p>





<p class="topicTitle">privacy & security</p>
	
<p class="entry"> Joanna Stern of the WSJ reports  <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a">A Basic iPhone Feature Helps Criminals Steal Your Entire Digital Life</a>.  </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUYODQB_2wQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) This hinges on the thief stealing your iPhone AND knowing your iPhone's passcode.  </p>

<p class="entry"> How would the thief know you iPhone passcode? In recent examples, thieves watched people in bars.  If the person typed their passcode at some point, the thieves watched & recorded this. Then the thief distracted the person and stole the iPhone itself.</p>

<p class="entry"> Having both physical possession of the iPhone and knowing the passcode allows the smart thieves to get into iCloud Keychain and to reset the iCloud ID password. Even if the user has 2FA set.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Any 3rd party app you have on your iPhone that has its own separate password should be safe from this attack, right?
Answer: It depends.  If you have enabled the 3rd party app to use FaceID, then the thief can skip FaceID and use the iPhone passcode and get in. If you did not enable the 3rd party app to use FaceID, then you are safe from this type of attack.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/iphone-stolen-passcodes-report/">responded</a> to the report saying,  `security researchers agree that iPhone is the most secure consumer mobile device, and we work tirelessly every day to protect all our users from new and emerging threats. We sympathize with users who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare. "We will continue to advance the protections to help keep user accounts secure.' Apple did not provide any specific details about any next steps it might take to increase security, Macrumors reports.</p>


<p class="entry"> Stern suggests protecting yourself by using a 3rd party password manager and avoiding typing your iPhone passcode in broad view (treat it like typing your PIN at a Bank ATM, cover it with your free hand when you are in public). </p>


<p class="entry"> It's worth noting that these types of thefts are possible not only for iPhones but for any Android device.  However, the iCloud entry by knowing only the iPhone passcode is a vulnerability worth considering.  </p>
