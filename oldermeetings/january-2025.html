to iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, announced Apple. `Voice Memos, a go-to app for musicians of all kinds, now offers iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max users the ability to layer a vocal track on top of an existing instrumental recording — without the need for headphones. With iOS 18.2, users will be able to play their original instrumental ideas through the iPhone speaker while simultaneously recording vocals using the new studio-quality microphones on iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.'  See the example Apple created, with `A trio of GRAMMY Award winners — multiplatinum entertainer Michael Bublé, country star Carly Pearce, and record producer Greg Wells', who teamed up to bring their new track “Maybe This Christmas” to life with Voice Memos on iPhone 16 Pro.'
