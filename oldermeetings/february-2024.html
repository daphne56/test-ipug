<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 17.3</p>

<p class="entry"> iOS 17.3 has been released.   </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is an <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">overview of the new features</a>, by Macrumors. </p>

<p class="entry">  Don't forget one of the anticipated security features: Stolen Device Protection.  You can enable it by going to Settings > Face ID & Passcode. </p>

<p class="entry"> Remember that this new Stolen Device Protection option is also intended to address the iPhone theft schemes that we covered in our  <a target=_top href="https://theipug.com/oldermeetings/january-2024">January 2024 iPUG meeting</a>, with Joanna Stern's extensive report.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Also, recall JoAnna Stern's security advice, independent of the 17.3 new security feature:  </p>

<p class="entry"> 1). Add a passcode to money apps, such as Venmo and Cash App, and make each passcode unique. 2). Delete any notes or photos that include personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers. 3). Store that stuff in a secure note inside a third-party password manager, such as Dashlane or 1Password. 4). Create a stronger iPhone passcode, one that uses letters and numbers. 5). The most obvious is the thief's own advice: Watch your surroundings and don‚Äôt give your passcode out. </p>





<p class="topicTitle">crash detection </p>

<p class="entry"> Recent models of iPhones and Apple watches have crash detection.  This continues to be a life-saving feature. </p>

<p class="entry"> First responders Maury County, Tennessee credit Apple‚Äôs Crash Detection feature with alerting them to a severe crash on New Year‚Äôs Day.  The driver‚Äôs iPhone got thrown out of the car during the crash, in the middel of a creek, but automatically contacted emergency services.  State officials said that iPhone Crash Detection calls turn out to be false alarms ‚Äúabout 75% of the time.‚Äù However, the rescue teams said they‚Äôd ‚Äúrather get false calls than miss a real emergency.‚Äù  Watch:</p>

<p class="entry">  In Yavapai county, AZ, officers were able to rescue a man who had crashed.   <a target=_top href="https://www.ycsoaz.gov/News-Articles/New-page-10">Dispatch received the original alert via a 911 text from his Apple watch</a>.  They dispatched a rescue team that spent hours looking for him.  They eventually found him wondering about 5 miles from his crashed car. </p>



<p class="topicTitle"> iPhone falling from a plane</p>

<p class="entry"> Recently, the story of the Boeing airplane whose door blew open made the news and investigations are underway. </p>

<p class="entry">  That same plane caused an iPhone to fall out: <a target=_top href="https://wapo.st/3StqpGL">Here‚Äôs how an iPhone survived a 16,000-foot fall from a plane</a>, reports the WaPo.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is the man who found the fallen iPhone: </p>

<p class="topicTitle">Messages and spam </p>


<p class="entry"> The number of spam messages or seemingly spam messages is increasing, as many cellphone users report, across all major providers: Verizon, AT&T, T-MObile.  With iOS 17, Apple offers the option to `Report Junk' when the sender is not in your contact list. </p>

<p class="entry"> Often, unsolicited text messages arrive from distribution lists, such as from political organizations asking for contributions or from businesses, or fundraising groups. Many of these offer an option to`opt out' but this requires replying to the text message.  Doing so, the best case means you have to engage with the sender and requires more steps than using Apple's `Report Junk' option. The worst case is that you are confirming the mobile number belongs to an active user. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is an example that Olga reported she got recently and  <a target=_top href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/119ee3a/hi_i_am_with_us_speaks_we_are_polling_ca/?cmdf=US+Speaks">many other users have gotten</a>.  </p>
