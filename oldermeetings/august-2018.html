He wrote: </p>

He said, `Apple worries about streaming music losing the human touch, alluding to Spotify's more algorithmic approach to highlighting content.’  Cook talked about human curation of playlists, not bits and bytes. The report continues, `Despite launching just three years ago, Apple Music has 50 million paid subscribers and free trial members, with the company slowly catching up to Spotify. At last count, Spotify said that it had 83 million paid subscribers around the world.’
