We thought that was enormous, and, back in the day, it was. But today's streaming services dwarf that, and I love it.  The stripped down esthetic of the HomePods, the overall ease of use, the excellent sound quality, and -- on sale -- cost makes me glad I bought them. I can't say that about every tech purchase. If you have an iOS device and love music, I recommend them.‚Äô </p>

<p class="entry">  Olga shared a battery tip for iOS devices: it‚Äôs OK to leave them plugged in overnight.  Devices charge fast up to 80% and then they are throttled.   </p>

<p class="entry"> However, it‚Äôs not recommended to leave iPhones and iPads plugged in while you do something that would ordinarily drain the battery faster -- such as to play CPU-intensive games. In that case, it‚Äôs best to play, let the battery drain, and charge them again.  Letting a device‚Äôs battery go through entire cycles is better.  This is a tip from Apple‚Äôs Genius Bar.  Apparently they see kids‚Äô iPhones batteries die faster this way because kids often leave them plugged in while they play games. </p>

He has type-2 diabetes and discusses how he uses an Apple Watch to monitor his health and exercise.  He writes, `It begins seven years ago, when my doctor asks me whether I want to lose my foot. I say to him: No, I do not want to lose my foot. ‚ÄòGood,‚Äô he says back: Monitor your blood sugar, keep it down, and we can manage this disease.`  </p>


<p class="entry"> Hon continues: `Gathering this new information requires a patchwork of services, so I approach it like an engineer. I track steps using wearable devices from Fitbit and Nike, and apps like Moves. I watch for high blood pressure with a Withings smart monitor. The data is stored alongside my weight, body fat percentage, and body mass index, all measured with a smart scale. And all the time there‚Äôs my blood glucose, measured six times a day, before and after each meal,‚Äù Hon writes. ‚ÄúI export the data as CSVs and view it in hand-crafted graphs and dashboards. My ad hoc monitoring system makes me an early adopter, a bona fide member of the quantified-self movement.` </p>

<p class="entry">  Hon concludes: `Seven years later, though, my fringe obsession has become mainstream. My cobbled-together system has been replaced by Apple‚Äôs shiny Health app, and I get prompted to exercise by a wearable that is more powerful than my first laptop. And my watch can even monitor my heart. Seven years ago I started tracking my blood sugar because I didn‚Äôt want to lose a foot. Now, after a month of using the Series 4 Apple Watch, I‚Äôm reminded what data can mean for my heart and, by extension, my mind.` </p>
