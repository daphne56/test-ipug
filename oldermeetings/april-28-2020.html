<p class="topicTitle"> Zooming in the era of COVID-19</p>



<p class="entry"> A few thousand years ago, it seems (i.e., last month), our iPUG meeting was held at Fronimo's.  Welcome to our Zoom meetings, starting this month. Welcome to our remote members who can now join from afar.  Welcome to all who are new to iPUG.  The meetings are always free and open to all. </p>

<p class="entry"> For now we will try Zoom and see if it works well for the iPUG meetings.  All feedback appreciated. </p>

<p class="entry">  Recall that FaceTime Video or Audio calls are recommended for better privacy and security over Zoom. For family members, it’s the way to go.  Correction: in our last iPUG meeting, the max number of group video calls via FaceTime was incorrect: the max is 32 people on a video call. </p>


<p class="entry"> Many organizations meet and work via Zoom now. Some have to clarify how to do it -- consider this  <a target=_top href="https://www.westonbar.org/so/61N5VoOJe?fbclid=IwAR3gBGUaUfpC8qs0612nMrw-lSDgZkDFiOiCcKGXBjd3SDS8PisCrslHN6c#/main">A Letter from the Honorable Dennis Bailey</a>, a judge addressing the Weston Bar Association. Read on to see what the judge has to say about attorneys and their attire during Zoom calls! ;-)</p>

<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>





<p class="entry">  Apple just released  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>.  It starts at $399.  It is smaller than the large iPhone 11 and appeals to those who want the smaller form factor.  </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223187/new-iphone-se-price-value-processor">the new iPhone SE is a Shockingly Good Value</a>, writes The Verge. </p>

<p class="entry">  John Gruber <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se">reviewed the new iPhone SE</a>.  It’s a very good overview and review.  He concludes: `The iPhone SE is an excellent value if you’re fine with the smaller display and Touch ID instead of Face ID. It’s an astoundingly good value if you flat-out prefer the smaller form factor and familiar Touch ID experience.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> John Gruber  <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard">reviewed the new Magic Keyboard</a> for iPad Pro. It's a thorough review and he concludes by saying it's a brilliant device.</p>

<p class="entry"> Your Apple Watch's complications are the itty bitty shortcuts you can add when you customize a watchface.  Some are provided by Apple, some are provided by 3rd party apps you might have.  Recall that you can customize your watchfaces in your iPhone's Watch app.  You can set up as many watchfaces as you like, each with its own settings  (colors, complications, etc.), and you can switch from one watchface to another by swiping left or right.  Each watchface is static once it's set up.  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watchsmith/id1483088503?ls=1">Watchsmith</a> is an app that lets you customize and personalize your Apple Watch's complications beyond what is available via the Watch app on your iPhone. </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watchsmith/id1483088503?ls=1">Watchsmith</a>  starts with a large set of  customizable complications, such as date,  weather,  astronomy.  Each can be customized   to  your preferences.  Then you can schedule their appearance to dynamically change, according to rules you define.  For instance, a  complication slot can be set up to display the weather first thing in the morning, then change to your calendar, then change to your Activity ring in the afternoon.   Watchsmith also includes complications such as a weather app, a workout app, a timezone converter, games and a calendar.  Take a look at this demo:</p>

<p class="entry">  What are best practices for washing, cleaning, disinfecting against COVID-19?  Here are the basics: </p>

<p class="entry"> A). Wash your hands frequently and don't touch your face.   </p>

<p class="entry"> B). If you think about it, our `hands' have natural and constant extensions: they are the technology we constantly touch and bring to our face: our iPhones.  And also our Apple Watches (smart watches of any kind are touched more frequently than a traditional watch).   Don't forget your glasses, they touch yoru face too.</p>
