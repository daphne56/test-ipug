<p class="entry"> ChatGPT continues to impress with its speed and relevance.  Olga described using it 
to help with a dog-related emergency in the middle of the night.  Chloe was having spasms and was unable to stand up, 
was disoriented and looked terrified. Olga called  <a target=_top href="https://www.vscot.com/site/home">VSCOT Emergency</a>
to get some advice about whether to bring in Chloe immediately or whether this could wait an 30-60 minutes to assess, and to understand possible conditions. 
VSCOT was generally unhelpful over the phone but advised bringing Chloe in because they could  diagnose and provide supportive care. 
Olga got off the phone with VSCOT and then asked ChatPGT, got a very useful list of possible conditions, 
and decided to take Chloe to VSCOT. </p>

<p class="entry"> Ten minutes after VSCOT took Chloe in the back to be examined, a tech told Olga that their `systems have been down all night' and 
they could not treat Chloe, not even supportive care such as an IV. They suggested going to  
<a target=_top href="https://www.veterinaryemergencygroup.com/locations/arizona/oro-valley-tucson">VEG</a> but could not provide the exact address 
nor a brochure/card and did not call ahead to let VEG know to expect Chloe. Olga looked up VEG on Apple Maps and 
got directions on her iPhone.  (The iPhone was in Dark mode, more on this later, see Tips & Tricks section below.)
</p>

<p class="entry">Thankfully Chloe was quickly triaged at VEG and the ER vet concluded that it was most 
likely `elderly vestibular disease`, with a small possibility that it was a stroke.  
Chloe was given anti-nausea drugs and was sent home with instructions.</p>

<p class="entry">Olga used ChatGPT again to get more info on canine vestibular disease and got a more well-rounded
overview than the printed instructions from the ER (even though the ER instructions were useful and appropriate).  </p>

<p class="entry">Summary:  This episode was an emergency in the middle of the night and was stressful for humans and dogs involved. 
The ER vet at VEG saved the day and treated Chloe as needed.  Yet on 2 occasions during this event, 
ChatGPT provided better and/or more complete information:  it was accurate, relevant, and quick. This info helped Olga decide what to do and how to manage Chloe's condition afterwards. 
However, it is important to remember that
ChatGPT has a warning that it can make mistakes and these warnings are appropriate. </p>

<p class="entry">Olga also reported that she is using ChatGPT to draw and design a backyard landscape and demonstrated examples. </p>


<p class="entry">Microsoft  <a target=_top href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/?utm_source=nl&utm_brand=wired&utm_mailing=WIR_Daily_070125&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=email&utm_content=WIR_Daily_070125&bxid=64e54a5408a22f35720aa601&cndid=74646268&hasha=5d6d7e11bbd7dabddc56d6fbd3df19e6&hashc=4483fce394be8c82247acc214c1aff3507608f702f9cbe46f2afc42a6f818b43&esrc=MARTECH_ORDERFORM&utm_term=WIR_Daily_Active">Says Its New AI System Diagnosed Patients 4 Times More Accurately Than Human Doctors</a>, reports WIRED. The tech giant poached several top Google researchers to help build a powerful AI tool that can diagnose patients and potentially cut health care costs.
However, Microsoft’s findings should be treated with some caution because doctors in the study were asked not to use any additional tools to help with their diagnosis, which may not be a reflection of how they operate in real life, WIRED reports.

<p class="topicTitle">tips & tricks</p>


 <p class="entry">Olga shared one more tip about emergencies.  Ordinarily she has her iPhone going to Dark mode at night.  However, she wanted to go to Light mode when she needed to see the Map directions in a hurry, to drive from one Emergency vet to the 2nd emergency vet.  It was 3:45 am and she needed to avoid fiddling with Settings on her iPhone. That night, she ended up driving with Maps in dark mode.  A few days after the emergency was over, she created a Focus mode called Emergency whose only purpose is to switch dark mode to light mode on her iPhone.  </p>
 

<p class="entry"> Recall that iOS on iPhone offers a very nice option to silence unknown callers.  This means that unknown callers go to your voice mail and they can choose to leave a message.   This works very well most of the time.  You can set it and forget it. But what do you do if you have an emergency where you need to disable this option temporarily?   This happened to Bernie and Olga recently when his car broke down and needed AAA assistance and expected a callback.  Would you remember how to disable this option in a hurry?  Would you feel inclined to wade through menus in Settings to look for it, while you are waiting by the side of the road and it's hot outside?  Would it be in Settings > Cellular?  (No, it is not.) You can find it in Settings > Apps > (scroll down to the "P" section which is not easy to scroll because the alphabet's font is tiny) and select Phone > (scroll down again) and select Silence Unknown Callers [Off].</p>


<p class="entry">Is there a better way to do this?  Olga attempted to create an iOS  Focus mode for such cases. It turns out, iOS 18 does not permit this option. You cannot access the setting `Silence unknown callers' in the controls provided by Focus modes. So Olga created 2 iOS Shortcuts and saved them on her iPhone's homescreen, creating 2 buttons tun turn on/off the option she wants.   </p>

<br>
    
 <br>     </p>
 
 
<p class="entry">Olga's recommendation is to consider what settings you might want to undo when you are in an urgent or emergency situation and prepare for it by setting up a combination of a Focus mode and iOS Shortcuts. (For example, do you want to allow downloads of apps from the App store with just a cellular connection? This came up because AAA suggested using their app to manage the roadside assistance.)  </p>
