The stunning display, beautiful design, quicksilver performance and knockout cameras add up to something special… if you like the idea of something so big it’s like a tablet, but feels like a phone, if you want the best cameras Apple has made, and if you need great battery life and fast performance, then look no further.'</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `We know the iPhone 12 can handle spills and splashes, but Apple may be downplaying just how water-resistant this phone really is. The iPhone 12’s IP68 rating means it can survive up to 19.6 feet (6 meters) of water for 30 minutes. This applies to all four iPhone 12 models: the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. But we discovered that like its predecessor, Apple’s newest iPhone can handle a great deal more than that. Both of the iPhone 11 models far exceeded the official rating, surviving a 39-foot dive in salt water in Monterey Bay, California. This year we took a brand-new iPhone 12 for a swim in the frigid fresh water of Lake Tahoe, on the other side of the Golden State, to test it out. ' </p></p>

(If you have macOS Big Sur or Catalina, this method uses Finder instead of iTunes.) </p>

<p class="entry">  An alternative method  <a target=_top href="https://osxdaily.com/2020/11/16/how-transfer-data-old-iphone-to-iphone-12/">uses a wireless method</a> from your od iPhone to the new one, or uses iCloud.  Fair warning: this method is easy and nice if you don’t have a lot of data, but this method is NOT fast, especially if you have a lot of photos, videos, or just a lot of data in general.  Also, be aware that if you need to leave the house with your new iPhone before the transfer completes, or interrupt this method several times, there is a chance you might have to start over, or might not complete and you could effectively lose the data that did not finish transferring.</p>

<p class="entry">  Recall that iOS provides and option to hide photos from view.  You can start with your Photostream, or in any Album, and tap Select, to select the photos you want to hide. (Or, you can be viewing one individual photo that you want to hide.)  Tap the share icon, and then tap Hide.  This will hide the photos you selected and will place them in an album called Hidden. You can choose to hide or show this album in iOS Settings > Photos.  When enabled, the Hidden album shows up un your Album list under Utilities.  </p>


<p class="entry"> To set up a  timer on your iPhone, you can navigate to the Clock app, then to the Timer tab. But if you want to set a timer even faster, you can go to Control Ceter and long-press the timer icon. This will pop up a vertical bar that you can control to set your time right there (it avoids the Clock app).</p>



<p class="entry">  If you want to select many emails at once, to move them or to delete them, you can tap Edit an select the ones you want.  However, there is a much faster way: in your mailbox list view, use 2 fingers to tap and drag.  Nice isn't’ it?  </p>


<p class="entry">  Camera tip: you can  take a photo by pressing the volume button on the side (you can choose the Up or Down button, they work equally well).  You can also press and hold a Volume button to engage the video quickly.  Hold it for the recording and release to end.  This is especially good when there is something you need to capture quickly. </p>


<p class="entry">  Recall that if you enable location data for your photos, you can get extra benefits from your Photos app (such as to place your photos on a map, to search by location, and many more).  However, there is a potential downside: you might not want to include location info when sharing a photo.  Luckily, you have this option: when you click on the share button, tap Options> (near the top of the window)  and un-select the Location data.</p>

<p class="entry"> If you want to decipher your iPhone’s Model number -- or if you are considering purchasing one used -- go to Settings > General > About to read the serial number.  The first letter tells you: M = was purchased new, F = refurbished, N = replacement, P = personalized;  Also, the letters after the numbers refer to where the iPhone was intended to be sold: LL = USA, X = Australia/New Zealand, CH = China, BR = Brazil, J = Japan, C = Canada.  Here  is <a target=_top href="https://beetstech.com/blog/decode-meaning-behind-apple-serial-number">more detail on the Serial Number meaning</a>. </p>


<p class="entry">  Calculator tip: if you entered a wrong number in the calculator you can swipe over it to delete the last digit (repeat for more).  </p>

<p class="entry"> Also, for a quick calculation, just use the Spotlight search: swipe down to invoke Spotlight search, then just type the quick calculation, such as 55/34. </p>

<p class="entry"> Recall that Apple is planning a new privacy feature that requires users to give explicit permission before letting apps track them for advertising purposes. The enhancement was added in iOS 14 operating system in September, but a requirement that all apps use it was delayed until early 2021.   Apple indicated that the delay in the release of this feature is to give 3rd party developers a little more time to adjust.  Bloomberg News reports  <a target=_top href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/apple-defends-decision-to-delay-privacy-feature-slams-facebook">Apple Defends Delay of Privacy Feature, Slams Facebook</a>.

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) Bloomberg quotes this excerpt from Apple's letter: `By contrast, Facebook and others have a very different approach to targeting. Not only do they allow the grouping of users into smaller segments, they use detailed data about online browsing activity to target ads. Facebook executives have made clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first and third party products to develop and monetize detailed profiles of their users, and this disregard for user privacy continues to expand to include more of their products.' </p>
