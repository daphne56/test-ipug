 <p class="entry">Apple writes: `Sound Therapy is a brand-new audio wellness collection on Apple Music, powered by Sollos. What if music could potentially improve your concentration, help you feel calmer, and get a better night’s sleep? Research suggests that listening to particular sound waves, auditory beats, and colored noise can impact how we feel.

With the help of cognitive scientists, music producers, and artists, our new offering uses gamma beats, theta beats, delta beats, white noise, and pink noise to enhance your day-to-day lifestyle without sacrificing the integrity of the music you love.

“Sound Therapy” is designed to support your overall wellbeing. It’s not intended to treat any medical condition.' </p>

<p class="entry">Use ChatGPT to ask about manuals you cannot easily find online. Even for manuals you can find online, it's still easier and faster, much better than a search engine.  Examples: your refrigerator's manual.  Your printer's manual. How to troubleshoot something on your iPhone. And so on. Don't forget privacy considerations, however.</p>

<p class="entry">Use ChatGPT (or other AI services) to ask about comparing items rather than doing the legwork yourself, such as comparing free online collaboration tools.  Or use AI for quick questions such as the adult dose of Benadryl, or to troubleshoot  iCloud syncing problems.</p>

 is a free online form builder.  It does not require any coding skills. You can use it to create an online form, a questionnaire, a survey, a poll, etc.  The end result gives you your own online form with its own URL that you can send to others. Additionally, you can also use the result to embed it in a website, if you wish.  They provide the code you can copy/paste in the website. Olga gave a demo.  There is a paid version of Tally that provides additional features.  Note: Unlike Google forms, this does not require a Google-login when responders are asked to upload a photo or a file. Olga discussed how this is a Tally advantage over Google forms, especially for a community.</p>
