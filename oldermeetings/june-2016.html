<h2>June 2016</h2>


<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>
	<p class="entry"> Apple's WWDC is next week.  The Keynote is at 10 am, Monday, June 13, and it will be streamed live by Apple.   </p> 

	 <p class="entry">  Mark your calendar and bookmark  <a target=_top href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/live/">This Apple Page for Live-streaming</a>. </p>

	</p>

	 <p class="entry">  What is expected to be announced at WWDC?  As always rumors abound and Apple does not pre-announce anything. However, the reasonable expectations include software-related announcements (and not any hardware news). Recall that in past years, Apple has given us previews of key features from the next majors OS releases: for iOS and for Mac OS X. </p>

	 <p class="entry">  Additional rumors/expectations: Apple Music will be redesigned, more uses for Siri, including possibly an SDK for Siri to be used by 3rd party developers. </p>

	 <p class="entry">  iOS 10 previews are expected.  It is also reasonable to anticipate increased security an privacy features, increased use of iCloud, as well as functions nobody guessed that will become obvious and necessary as soon as Apple demonstrates them. </p>

	 <p class="entry">  What else can be expected? Tons of websites using clickbait headlines  and  long wish-lists claiming to be actual news.  After the Keynote, we also expect that Apple's stock will temporarily drop (and more headlines will claim that Apple missed the mark). Later, the stock will rise again and sales will be brisk with the new releases. This is not our first rodeo.</p>

<p class="topicTitle"> 	iOS apps </p>



<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com">GoodNotes</a> is a must-have app for anyone who needs to take extensive notes or annotate PDFs.  Olga recommends it highly after relying on it for a month at work and for personal use. There are many apps of this kind but GoodNotes is the best.  A good overview is available via the online<a target=_top href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com/user-guide/getting-started.html"> User Guide</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  Roger told us about <a target=_top href="http://www.stedwardenterprises.com">DashCam</a> app.  He uses it with an older iPhone that he has dedicated and set on his car's dashboard. It continually takes photos and video as you drive but over-writes the older photos, assuming that in almost all cases, you had an uneventful drive.  In the event you need to keep a photo or a video, you can tap and save it.  This is a better alternative than scrambling to find your iPhone as you try to                  document something in a hurry. DashCam is a free app that  helps  fight unjust tickets, insurance fraud, and provide data in case of an accident.</p>

<p class="entry">  If you need to create or share lists for grocery shopping or lists of any kind, consider <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a>.  Olga has been using it for a couple of weeks after many years of relying on GroceryGadgets which has gone downhill. AnyList is a very nice app with very responsive developers.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waterlogue/id764925064?mt=8">Slow Shutter</a> is a camera app that lets you slow down your iPhone's or iPad's shutter in order to do long exposures to get trail lights of cars at night, or capture the blur from misty waterfalls, and so on. </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://blog.fiftythree.com">Paper</a> released v 3.6 today with new features and improvements.  The best app on iOS just got a little better :-)</p>
