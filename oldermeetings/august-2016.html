After earning several Design Awards, much critical acclaim, and a popular following, it saddened its users and the community by permanently coming to an end.

This is not an upgrade, but a fully new app. `Entering text, like passwords and usernames, is much easier with the iOS Remote app because any text field automatically brings up a keyboard. Full Siri voice commands are supported, as is dictation. Because it includes the same gyroscope and accelerometer in the Siri Remote, an iPhone can be used as a dedicated game controller for playing games on the Apple TV.' .   Here is an overview: </p>

<p class="entry"> For musicians and music players,  <a target=_top href="http://forscore.co">forScore</a> is a smart sheet music app for iPads. It lets you do everything you can do with paper sheets of music, and more. As it uses PDF files,  you can scan your existing collection or use  anything you find online. You can annotate with an Apple Pencil. </p>


<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/">Notebook</a> is designed to be an all-purpose notebook for notes, lists, audio recordings and photos.  It works on iPhones and iPads and it's an alternative to Evernote. It also has an optional Apple Watch app. You can create `notebooks' and within each one, you can place cards. There are 4 card types: text, to-do lists, pictures, and audio recordings. You can pinch cards together and combine them in a notebook or unpinch them to separate them.  You can easily create colorful pages and chose from a list of beautiful fonts for your text. The app works on a single iOS device but also syncs across all of them, if you want to.  It's a free download. While it does not have all the Evernote functionality today, it's well worth trying, plus they claim more is in the works, such as a web app, clipping ability, and so on.  </p>

<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> has just released a significant upgrade with v2 for both iOS and Mac.  These can be used independently or together with syncing. You can now have multiple journals.  The UI is even nicer.  Most importantly, they have released their own sync service, eliminating sync options via iCloud or Dropbox.  They also offer optional backup in iCloud. Finally, the next upgrade will offer end-to-end encryption. </p>

<p class="entry"> Do you want to see your iPhone or iPad data on your Mac or PC?  <a target=_top href="https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/">iExplorer</a>  is your answer. It's NOT an iOS app.  It's a `desktop' app that reads your iOS backup data from iTunes on your desktop computer and lets you easily access it and transfer files back and forth to your iOS devices. </p>





<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="http://www.pixelmator.com/ios/">Pixelmator</a> for iOS continues to add sophisticated features that are typically found on a desktop-class professional photo editing app.   For example, take a look at how their new quick selection works:</p>

<p class="entry">  An example of a very practical use of  <a target=_top href="https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/">iExplorer</a>: Olga needed to clear up some storage capacity on her iPhone and she realized that the Messages app had by far the highest capacity usage. In Settings, she had selected the choice to keep old messages forever.  Before deleting old messages, she wanted to save an old but important conversation. She used  <a target=_top href="https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/">iExplorer</a> on her Mac to export the old conversation to a PDF. Here is  <a target=_top href="https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/tutorials/how-to-transfer-and-backup-sms-and-imessages">How to transfer text messages to your Mac or PC</a>.  She then changed her iPhone Settings to keep only one year's worth of old Messages, and ended up clearing about 4 GB of capacity.</p>


<p class="entry"> The food website  <a target=_top href="https://food52.com">Food52</a> is a very nice online magazine and online community for recipes, food advice, and sharing information. They also have an app  <a target=_top href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1048175860">(Not) Recipes by Food52</a>, which is free and works on all iOS devices. It's designed to help you find—and share—cooking ideas and inspiration using photos. It's not intended to give formal recipes, rather it shows how cooking happens spontaneously by people sharing their experiences.</p>


<p class="entry">  Dropbox  <a target=_top href="https://www.dropbox.com/productivity">has new productivity tools</a>, including a scanning function that lets you easily snap a photo of a document, a white board, or a napkin with text and drawings.  It automatically cleans it up and straightens it, and uploads a PDF document to a folder of your choice. </p>

		<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a> is an iOS app for making list of any kind.  It also includes many additional features for creating grocery and shopping lists. Olga has been using it for the past 3 months and gave an overview. </p>
		
		<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">AnyList</a> recently got a significant update, improving its  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/mac">Mac version</a>, as well as its  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/web/about">web-based view</a>.  These are optional versions of the app for users who want to access their lists on any device, including a PC via the web version of the app..</p>
		
		<p class="entry">  Lists can be created by a single user or can be shared across a family or group of people.</p>
		
		<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/">AnyList</a> is a free iS app.  Additionally, it offers premium features to those who choose to pay $8/ year (individual) or $12/year (families).  Olga decided to upgrade to premium within a couple of days.</p>
		
		<p class="entry"> Here is an  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/lists">overview of features</a>, most of which come with the free version of the app.  You can add photos and notes to items, filter by store, categorize, and customize the view via themes. If you create a lot of lists, you can also create folders to manage them more easily. You can protect individual lists with a passcode.</p>
		
		<p class="entry"> The app offers location-based reminders for when you are near a store. </p>
		
		<p class="entry"> Location-based reminders also optionally work on an Apple Watch. </p>
		
		<p class="entry"> Here is an overview of  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/premium">premium features</a> offered by AnyList. </p>
		
		<p class="entry"> Support online is easy via a quick <a target=_top href="http://help.anylistapp.com">How-To page</a> to answer frequently asked questions.</p>
		
		<p class="entry">  This app is even better than what meets the eye initially.  There are some nice touches, such as an easy view of recently used items on a list, shaking to undo a crossed-off item, and much more.  </p>
		
		<p class="entry"> There are also some major features, such as the ability to import recipes directly from websites and the ability to plan your meals using the recipes and a calendar view. To import recipes, they offer web browser extensions that work on iOS Safari as well as desktop  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com/recipes/browser-extensions">Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and even on IE</a>.  </p>
		
		<p class="entry"> In fact, the recipe view alone makes this app much more than a `list-making' app.  It is a better recipe app than note-taking apps which offer recipe-clipping functions (and much, much better than, say, Evernote's clipper).   You can scale recipes (up/down), you can identify ingredients you need to buy and place them on a list.  After an ingredient is added to a list, a note automatically references the recipe where it came from to help you remember why you need an item or whether to skip it later on.  </p>
