<p class="entry">  A tip for your Mail app settings in order to avoid automatically giving info to senders about when you read their email. On iOS, go to Settings > Mail > and uncheck Load Remote Images. On macOS, go to Mail > Preferences > Viewing and uncheck the option to Load remote content in messages.</p>


<p class="entry">  Olga recommends the macOS app  <a target=_top href="https://daisydiskapp.com">DaisyDisk</a>.  It recently helped her easily find what was eating up a lot of disk space on her iMac: it was old iOS backups from devices she had sold or given away.  Deleting these old and unnecessary backups helped clear up about 100 GB of space.  Of course, DaisyDisk does more and can be used for many purposes.  It's fast and easy to use.</p>
