<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>
	


<p class="entry">  We are all waiting for glimpses of the new iPhone line and just got an accidental release of info via  <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/01/homepod-os-release">beta code from the HomePod</a>, a separate product that apple will release at the end of the year.  Gruber summarizes and reports the details. </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple reported  financial results today <a target=_top href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/08/apples-q3-fy17-financial-results/"> and Jason Snell graphed everything</a>. `In the most recent quarter, the company earned $45.4 billion in revenue, up from $42.4 billion in the year-ago quarter.' </p>

<p class="entry">  In the news the last several days:  <a target=_top href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html">Apple has removed VPN apps from its Chine-based app store</a>, The NY Times reports. The president of one of the VPN companies said: `We gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I., so we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal.' He added, `We view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits.'  </p>

<p class="entry">  However, John Gruber  <a target=_top href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/apple_china_vpn_apps">writes about  China's laws and demands regarding the use of VPN</a>, pointing out that `Amazon is sending cease and desist letters to AWS customers using VPNs in China. Apple is not alone.'  In fact, Apple has said that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. `We have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations. These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business' Apple has said.  John Gruber points out that not all encrypted communications are restricted, most notably, iMessage and FaceTime.</p>





<p class="entry">  A preview of iOS 11: some very nice features when using an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil: Instant Markup and Instant Notes features.
