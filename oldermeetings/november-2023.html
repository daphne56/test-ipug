<p class="entry">   Apple held an event called Scary Fast on Oct 30, the day before Halloween.   <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips/">They unveiled the new  Macs with the new M3 chips</a>. </p>

This is a very thorough review with lots of performance and other info. </p>




<p class="entry"> Behind the scenes from last week's Apple event was arguably equally interesting: </p>


<p class="entry"> Apple released a Behind-the-Scenes brief video: `Take a look at an Apple Event shot on iPhone 15 Pro. The team behind the curtain talks process. The director shoots in low light with amazing results — while treating iPhone 15 Pro like a real pro camera. Pro workflow specialists name-drop the trio supercharging video on iPhone 15 Pro: ProRes, Apple Log, and USB-C. World-renowned colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld explains how the footage gives him more freedom to create. And the editor talks about bringing the vision to life seamlessly.'

<p class="entry"> There was some criticism on social media that Apple used professional equipment in addition to an iPhone 15 in order to film the Mac event last week. Such criticism is not really fair nor cognizant of what it takes to create any professional video, even when traditional cameras are used, Stephen Robles points out:  </p>

<p class="entry">  In Messages, if you tap the `+' just to the left of the text field, there are a bunch of apps that show up on a stack.

Just go to Settings  Messages > apps and uncheck the ones you don't want to clutter your view. </p>


<p class="entry"> With iOS 17, there are a bunch of new ringtones and sounds.  It's worth checking them out. Go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics and try them out.  It's worth checking the new text message tones. </p>

When Elizabeth finds herself fired from her lab, she accepts a job as a host on a TV cooking show, and sets out to teach a nation of overlooked housewives — and the men who are suddenly listening — a lot more than recipes.' Here is the trailer:</p>

<p class="entry"> Apple Watch is being leveraged to help flag signs of Parkinson's disease. PD affects more than half a million Americans and the rate has been increasing.   <a target=_top href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/24/apple-watch-parkinsons-disease-apps-parky-strivepd-neurorpm/">STAT journal reports:</a> `While there is no cure for Parkinson’s and treatment options can be daunting, people with the disease can now turn to technology spawned by the Apple Watch to take an active role in their care much as continuous glucose monitors have helped people manage diabetes better. Over the past year, the Food and Drug Administration has cleared three Apple Watch apps from independent developers to track symptoms associated with Parkinson’s that can help inform treatment decisions for people and their doctors.'</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) “I still don’t think we’ve even scratched a fraction of what the potential could be,” said Ray Dorsey, a neurologist and researcher at the University of Rochester who worked on the first study of Parkinson’s using Apple devices in 2015. “I think we’re going to rapidly get to a point where these tools are going to identify people who are at high risk for developing Parkinson’s disease.” </p>

<p class="entry"> The  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parkinson-mpower-2/id1375781575">mPower app</a> has been available since 2015 and has enrolled over 10,000 participants and it's the largest Parkinson's Disease study ever created. Anyone can join, including those without the disease. This app helps researchers get data from the iPhone's gyroscope and other  features to measure dexterity, balance, gait, and memory. This is providing researchers with insight into the factors that make symptoms better or worse, such as sleep, exercise, and mood.</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd)  `A new sensor to detect when a person’s blood pressure is elevated. The initial system won’t show a user their exact systolic and diastolic measurements, but the company is working on a follow-up version for later that could. This will be coupled with a new blood pressure journal so a user can notate what was happening when hypertension occurred,' reports Bloomberg. </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `A new system to detect sleep apnea. The Apple Watch will monitor a person’s sleeping and breathing habits to predict if a person has the condition. An app will then recommend a user follow-up with a doctor,' reports Bloomberg. </p>
