<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>
	

<p class="entry"> Apple released  <a target=_top href="http://macdailynews.com/2018/01/23/apple-releases-ios-11-2-5/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wordpress%2FxhfA+%28MacDailyNews%29">iOS 11.2.5, with these new features</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/apple-coo-williams-says-new-health-record-beta-is-right-thing-to-do.html">Will Let You Keep Your Medical Records on your iPhone</a> , reports CNBC.</p>

<p class="entry">  With this news about health data on the iPhone, Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/apple-will-finally-replace-the-fax-machine-in-health-care-commentary.html">will finally replace the fax machine in health care</a>, writes CNBC. `We’ve seen some spectacular advances in fields ranging from surgery to gene editing, but health care still faces a lackluster problem: Many patients can only get health records from their doctor if the fax machine is working. Even when records are stored electronically, different chunks of every patient’s health information sit in inaccessible electronic record systems in different doctors’ offices.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) `Things are finally changing. Using Apple’s iPhone Health app, patients will soon be able to download and view health records on their phones. Apple uses Smart to connect the health app to hospitals and doctors’ offices. The good news for patients, doctors and innovators is that Apple chose a standardized, open connection over a proprietary, closed one. This approach lets any other app, whether running on the web, iPhone, or Android, use that same interface to connect. So Apple will compete on value and customer satisfaction, rather than on an exclusive lock on the data.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/technology/Apple-iPhone-medical-records.html">in a Sign of Health Ambitions, Adds medical Records Feature for iPhone</a>, reports the NY Times. `A dozen medical institutions across the United States -  including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles - have agreed to participate in the beta version of the new feature.  Apple will not be able to see the user's health records.</p>

<p class="entry">  Apple’s  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/homepod/">HomePod</a> is (finally) out. </p>

<p class="entry"> HomePod is out and  <a target=_top href="https://www.cultofmac.com/525223/why-homepod-is-actually-a-steal-at-349/">it's actually a steal</a>, writes CultofMac.  `Don’t make the mistake of comparing HomePod to rival smart speakers and lamenting its $349 price tag. There are good reasons why the device costs more than three times as much as an Amazon Echo - and yet is still an absolute steal. The technology packed into HomePod is what makes it so special - and unlike anything else in its price range. Its seven tweeters, six microphones, and a high-excursion woofer come together to deliver high-fidelity sound that’s tailored to your room. This creates ‘an all-encompassing sense of space — and consistent, high-fidelity audio everywhere in the room.'</p>

<p class="entry"> David Pogue  <a target=_top href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-pogues-sneak-preview-apple-homepod-190227102.html">review the HomePod</a>.  He notes that it’s has better sound than all of its competitors. `In a devastatingly effective demo, Apple lines up four of these things: The Google Home Max ($400), Sonos One ($200), Amazon Echo ($100), and the HomePod. They’re volume-matched and rigged to an A/B/C/D switch, so a single song can hop from one to the other. (Apple even installed a halo backlight behind each speaker that illuminated to show you which one was playing.)

The HomePod sounded the best. Its bass, in particular, was amazing: full and deep, but also distinct and never muddy — you could hear the actual pitch of the bass notes, not just the thud. That, unsurprisingly, is where other small speakers have trouble.’ </p>
