<p class="entry">  Mary Anne points us to  <a target=_top href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/callie-byrnes/2017/02/this-woman-found-a-lost-iphone-and-what-she-found-on-it-left-her-horrified/">an article about a misplaced iPhone</a>.  The person who found it could ask Siri for information, revealing personal data. This is not a bug, it’s a preference. This is good or bad, depending on your perspective: it’s a daily convenience for you, as you can avoid unlocking your iPhone to ask Siri something, and it could help the finder return a lost iPhone. If you want to avoid this, you must disable Siri when the screen is locked.  Go to Settings > Siri > Access Siri when locked, and turn the option off.</p>


 <p class="entry"> Gail points us to  <a target=_top href="http://gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cloudbleed-the-lates-1792710616?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=recirculation&utm_campaign=fridayPM">Everything you need to know about Cloudbleed, the latest internet security breach</a>, Cloudfare’s vulnerability. Who is Cloudfare? You might not be using them directly but they provide services and security to many other internet-based companies and services, including some you might be using. As a precaution, it's a good idea to update your passwords, at least some of your key ones and to set up 2-factor authentication for IDs and services that are important to you. (Note: Many iPUG members use 1Password.  <a target=_top href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/02/23/three-layers-of-encryption-keeps-you-safe-when-ssltls-fails/">1Password was NOT affected by this vulnerability</a>, as they noted in a blog post to users.) </p>

 <p class="entry"> Betty has a follow-up to our VPN discussion from last month’s meeting, pointing us to International Travel News magazine, where author Jim Doyle writes, ` When I was in Uzbekistan in April 2016 and attempted to review my checking account, it triggered my bank to block further online access to my account, as they suspected fraud. I had alerted the bank to all of the countries I would be visiting on my trip to Central Asia, but I was unaware that my VPN uses a server in the Netherlands. Once I was able to call the bank via Skype and tell them I had used a VPN, my access was restored.
For future foreign trips, I’ll be sure to mention the VPN in addition to the countries I’ll be visiting, after confirming where the VPN’s servers are.'  This is a good reminder for those who use VPN services: either manually choose a server in the US, if possible, or notify financial institutions in advance of your trip. </p>

<p class="topicTitle">watch</p>
	

<p class="entry"> Since watchOS 3 was released last fall, it is possible to  <a target=_top href="https://finertech.com/2017/01/20/apple-watch-faces-for-all-occasions/">arrange watch faces for work, play, music, and every occasion in between</a>, writes David Chartier.  The key is that you can easily sweep between watch faces the same way you swipe between pages on an iPhone or iPad. </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga has been using the same approach, with some examples of customized watch faces, below.  Complications on the watch are shortcuts to apps.  She modifies these watch faces (or adds a new one) every so often to adjust to new needs (such as for travel).  Apple has made it very easy to take advantage of this flexibility to customize.  </p>

<p class="entry">  <br>

    <img src="../images/watch-olga-1-morning.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/watch-olga-2-errands.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>
    
<br>
    
    Above, this the watch face Olga uses in the mornings to see the activity rings and for easy access to Activity app via complication (shown at the bottom; it displays the most recent activity type and it’s a shortcut to the Workout App).  The complication at the top left is  <a target=_top href="https://darksky.net/app/">Dark Sky</a> which displays the temperature and is a shortcut to the app for the fuller forecast. The complication on the upper right is  <a target=_top href="https://streaksapp.com">Streaks</a> which lets the user set up 6 goals, with each dot representing a goal; bold dots indicate goal completion. 
    
    <br>
    
    <br>
    
    The next watch face is used when running errands, for easy access to  <a target=_top href="https://www.anylistapp.com">Any List</a>.  The pretty flowers change every time a user checks the time.  Olga often changes this to show animated butterflies or jellyfish.
    
  <br>
  <br>  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  
     
    <img src="../images/watch-olga-3-fun.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/watch-olga-4-night-event.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>

<br>

   
Minnie, above, is a watch face Olga uses just for fun.  When tapped, Minnie reads the time out loud (preference in Settings).  Minnie’s skirt color is customizable. Below Minnie this minimalistic watch face is used during evening events and dressier occasions. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
    

 
 <img src="../images/watch-olga-5-favealbum.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="290" height="369"></a>
 <br>
 <img src="../images/watch-olga-6-favealbum.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="290" height="369"></a>
 
 <br>
 
 The two screenshots above are examples of the `Favorite Album’ watch face. It cycles through a user’s designated favorite album every time a user looks at the time (these are paintings created on an iPad using  <a target=_top href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artrage/id391432693?mt=8">ArtRage</a> and  <a target=_top href="https://www.fiftythree.com">Paper</a>, respectively, and imported in the favorite album on the iPhone).  Notice that the font’s color is different in each case: it is automatically adjusted by the Watch in order to be easily readable vs. the background image. Notice also that many colors choices would allow good contrast for reading, however Apple’s automation chooses colors within the palette of the image. Details like these are a delight on the Watch.
    
  <br> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
 <img src="../images/watch-olga-7-much-info.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>
 
 <br>
 
 This last watch face is the `Modular’ option.  It’s the watch face that allows the maximum number of complications.  Olga used to use it a lot before watchOS 3 was released because it enabled easy access to many shortcuts. However, now that it’s so easy to swipe between watch faces, Olga prefers to use the other ones listed above.
 <br>

<img src="../images/watch-olga-dock.jpg" alt="screenshot" width="295" height="369"></a>

<br>

Olga no longer uses a complication to access the timer (as shown in the Modular watch face above).  Instead, she has customized the Dock to include Timer, as shown above.  This is an example of ow watchOS 3 improved the flow of information and shortcuts on the watch.





<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/blossoming-new-world-apple-watch-apps/">The blossoming new world of watch apps</a>, writes David Chartier.  He gives good examples of apps he uses on the Watch, including: Drafts, Hours, AnyList, and more.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga’s view: It is easy to add too many apps on the watch and not use them. A little goes a long way: the watch is a small device and many apps belong more naturally on the iPhone itself.  However, judicious use of a few watch apps can be wonderful. The examples David Chartier mentions above showcase this.  Choose the apps that matter to you and customize your watch faces.</p>

<p class="entry"> Some 3rd party apps that offer a Watch companion app use too much battery. This can happen when there is too much communication between the iPhone and the watch occurring the background (not initiated by the user). However, most 3rd party apps are mindful of this. </p>

There are water-resistant and water-proof versions also.</p>
