And: `The MyShake app relies on earthquake information calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey’s backbone ShakeAlert system, which gathers earthquake sensing data from a network of hundreds of ground sensors throughout the West Coast. Such systems can work particularly well in strong earthquakes, providing seconds of alert that allow dentists to remove drills from mouths, elevators to let passengers off and allow people to drop, cover and hold on before strong shaking hits.' </p>

<p class="topicTitle">iOS apps </p>
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.tryhealium.com">Helium AR</a> is the app mentioned in the News section above, that helps veterans with anxiety, via guided meditation. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is the  app mentioned in the news section above:<a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1467058529">MyShake</a>. The MyShake app -- developed by the UC Berkeley Seismology Lab, sponsored by the State of California Office of Emergency Services -- is the first app to provide statewide earthquake early warning alerts. The app is one of the delivery modes of the California Earthquake Early Warning System. </p>

<p class="entry">  For all nature lovers:  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-explorers/id1436285774">The Explorers (app store link)</a> and  <a target=_top href="https://theexplorers.com/landing">The Explorers (overview)</a> is described as: `the best app to explore and share our Earth wonders’ to the Earth inventory of photos and videos. Photographers or videographers, amateurs or professionals, scientists, associations, artists and citizens of the world: join The Explorers community! Share your best photos and videos for free and free of advertising, and join a human adventure at the service of Nature!'  It's available for all iOS devices and won app of the year (2019) for AppleTV.</p>

<p class="entry"> If you want a different look when you photograph scenery, consider long exposures to capture the movement of water or the trails of car taillights in the highway.  <a target=_top href="https://spectre.cam">Spectre camera</a> is an app that is designed for this purpose and uses smart technology to create the best exposures. Apple awarded it  `App of the year (2019) for iPhones'.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.shopmoment.com/moment-pro-camera-app">Moment Camera Pro</a> is a camera app for iOS that gives you more professional-style, manual controls: ISO, shutter, focus, RAW access, histograms, and much more. </p>

<p class="entry"> As you may recall, with iOS 13, Apple re-did the reminders app from the ground up, giving it some very nice new features.  However, the downside is for those who have multiple devices (Macs, iPads, iPhones, etc.) and for various reasons, not all devices can upgrade to the latest version of OS.  In these instances, Reminders for iOS13 only syncs across devices running the latest OS versions.  As a temporary workaround, Olga has been using Apple Notes with great success.  She has created a single note with various Todo's (and several categories).  She has pinned the note to the top, so it's always easy to access.  The note syncs across all devices. </p>

<p class="entry"> Recall that if you want to partially share your iPad or iPhone with someone, using Kiosk Mode is an excellent option.  It lets you place your device in restricted mode, where, say, you only allow someone to use Safari to surf the web, without having to give access to your personal data such as notes, photos and all your other apps. Olga continues to recommend this feature:  <a target=_top href="https://www.webascender.com/blog/setup-kiosk-mode-lock-ipad-just-one-app/">See how to set it up</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> However, on some rare occasions, Kiosk Mode can get stuck: you cannot exit to regular mode to make full use of your device.  Olga discovered a nice way to get out when all else fails: Use Find My (from another device or computer) to place your stuck device in Lost Mode. Once that happens, the device is automatically locked.  This also takes it out of Kiosk Mode.  Problem solved. :-)</p>

<p class="entry"> We can consider our security and privacy on an individual level.  This alone can be disturbing when violated, and it's very often violated in our digital lives unless we take great measures.
