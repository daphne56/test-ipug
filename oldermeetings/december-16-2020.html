<p class="topicTitle">iOS Digital Notebooks</p>
	
	
	
	
<p class="entry"> Recall that  <a target=_top href="https://www.goodnotes.com">GoodNotes</a> is one of the best iOS apps for handwritten notes, especially on an iPad.  It is beautiful, natural like paper, and digitally searchable. It's  very powerful app.</p>

<p class="entry"> As your GoodNotes notebooks grow, they can be more challenging to organize or navigate.   <a target=_top href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/AmethystGarnet">Amethyst & Garnet</a> offers digital notebooks that answer this challenge nicely. These notebooks are like templates that can be used with GoodNotes to  offer structure and organization.  Kieran is the creative force behind this. She lives in Sydney, Australia. She writes:</p>

<p class="entry"> `My life was hectic even before I had my 2 boys and once I did it seemed that I had no time to do everything I needed to and it felt like the stuff I did finish was messy and unorganised. I began to create little planners and lists to help me structure my life and allow me to have a bit of breathing space. It has made such a wonderful difference in my life and it allowed me to open my first business which involved selling digital artwork. I thought that it would only seem logical to share my planners and organizational tools with others in the hope that it may help someone else in the same boat that I was in. I take a lot of pride and spend a lot of time in my work; researching, designing and adding as many designs as possible when I'm not busy with my little family.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> Kieran will join our Zoom meeting today for a live discussion of her work. </p>

<p class="entry">  Olga recently bought <a target=_top href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/889948519/digital-notebook-hyperlinked-tabs-bullet?ref=hp_rf-3">10 digital notebooks (landscape orientation)</a> from Amethyst & Garnet and recommends it highly. She reports using a tabbed notebook for all her notes and planning.  Kieran offers  <a target=_top href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/AmethystGarnet">many more styles and digital notebooks</a>, including some for teaching, gardening, journaling, and more.</p>
