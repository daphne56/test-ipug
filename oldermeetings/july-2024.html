<p class="entry">Last month, afer Apple's WWDC announcements, John Gruber sat down with  John Giannandrea, Craig Federighi, and Greg Joswiak for a discussion/interview. It is a 2-hour discussion but it can be easily broken into 30 min segments and it's worth watching. It gives a better understanding of how Apple is thinking about the new offerings,  and includes a very thoughtful discussion of AI. </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga tried  <a target=_top href="https://www.timeshifter.com">Timeshifter</a> during a recent trip to Athens and reported on her experience with the app. It can definitely help with jet lag management. To make the best use of the app, it helps to be organized.  For example, to avoid packing your bags the night before you travel, so you have available down time for time shifting. Also, if you are open to taking Melatonin, the app helps you optimize the timing.  If not, the app helps you manage timing of caffeine and exposure to light at optimal times.  Timeshifting begins 2 days before your trip, and goes on for 2 days after your arrival.  The same happens on the return. The first roundtrip is free.  Beyond that, the app requires payment.
