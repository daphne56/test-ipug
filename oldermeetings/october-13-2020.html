<p class="topicTitle"> about 5G</p>


<p class="entry"> The 2 types of 5G explained:  <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mmwave-vs-sub-6ghz-5g/">mmWave vs. Sub-6GHz 5G iPhones: What's the Difference?</a> `All of the iPhones in Apple's iPhone 12 lineup will have Qualcomm modems that support 5G, but potential buyers need to know that not all 5G networks are equal. There's the super fast mmWave (millimeter wave) 5G and the slower but more widespread Sub-6GHz 5G.'</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d from above): `There are two kinds of 5G networks: mmWave, which is the super-fast 5G that most people are talking about when they talk about 5G speed improvements, and sub-6GHz, the 5G that most people are going to experience for the time being.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d from above): `Apple employees that have been testing the 5G iPhones recently (and confidentially) told Bloomberg that the 5G speeds have been disappointing as the current 5G networks are not “improving connection speeds much.” Most people who are expecting their iPhones to deliver super-fast mmWave speeds will likely end up similarly disappointed when they find that mmWave networks just aren’t available in most places.’ </p>

<p class="entry"> What is  <a target=_top href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3406470/5g-faq-iphone-12-performance-speed-carriers-mmwave-availaibity.html">5G and what does it mean for iPhone?</a>  Macworld also has an overview. </p>


<p class="entry">  Example of map coverage:  <a target=_top href="https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/">Verizon's 5G map today, considered to be the widest in the US, among all carriers</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  Reuters reports:  <a target=_top href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26X18E">New Apple 'iPhone 12' to offer 5G speeds U.S. networks can't deliver</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d)  Reuters: `The device, dubbed the iPhone 12 by analysts, can tap into 5G, or fifth generation wireless technology, that theoretically operates as much as 10 to 20 times faster than current 4G wireless networks. Current 5G U.S. networks mostly use low-band wireless spectrum, or airspace, that is slower than high-band spectrum, but more reliable over longer distances. It will likely take years before the massive speed boost phone carriers promise will make augmented reality and real-time cloud gaming seamless.''</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) Reuters:  `Several U.S. telecom operators have deployed networks based on lower spectrum bands, with slightly higher speeds than 4G. A noticeably faster variant of “mid-band” 5G is also being rolled out, but it is unlikely to reach three-quarters of Americans until 2025, estimated longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster of venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.''</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont’d) Reuters:  The fastest speeds touted by carriers are a type of 5G called millimeter Wave, or mmWave, that work over shorter distances. Verizon Communications Inc has the largest current mmWave network, available only in limited areas.</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-mirrors/id1462986362">Hidden Mirrors</a> is a casual puzzle game. The player reproduces geometric patterns in the fewest moves possible.  It’s visual, addictive and just the right amount of an 80s vibe.
The goal of the game is to fill the highlighted tiles, either one at a time, or by swiping to mirror everything you’ve filled already. The way the symmetries unfold appear deceptively simple, and it becomes a pleasant visualization exercise to predict how the inner shapes will interact.  Hidden Mirrors is free for a limited time.</p>	
	
	
	
	<p class="entry"> Now that iOS  14 is out, an increasing number of app are offering homescreen Widgets.  Here is an expanding list:  <a target=_top href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/09/16/ios-14-widget-apps/"> Homescreen widgets, app clips, and more</a>, reports 9to5Mac. </p>
