<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Grip-for-Apple-Pencil/ct/5604">Kaweco Grip for Apple Pencil</a> gives your Apple Pencil a protective and comfortable sleeve. `Its lightweight aluminum design combines Kaweco's classic octagonal barrel design with a wide, knurled grip section to help you wield your Apple Pencil with comfort and precision. The Grip's integrated screw mechanism holds the Apple Pencil gently but securely, with no wobbling. You can also charge the Apple Pencil wirelessly without removing it from the Grip.'   Also, the Kaweco Grips  fit both the first and second generation pencils, but the Grip is not compatible with some features of the second generation Apple Pencil. Specifically, the Apple Pencil 2 needs to be removed from the grip to make use of the touch controls, magnetic attachment, and wireless charging capabilities.

<p class="topicTitle">privacy & security</p>
	
<p class="entry"> Smoking and depression apps <a target=_top href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/22/smoking-depression-apps-are-selling-your-data-google-facebook-study-finds/">are selling your data to Google and Facebook, reports The Washington Post on a study</a>.  The study looked at sample apps, not everything available. But it is a red flag in general.  Be mindful of health apps or any apps that have broad appeal, as they are potential moneymakers. Read privacy policies.  Only use apps you trust. </p>

<p class="entry"> For those who are curious, Olga tracked the actual study.  It is published by JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association:   <a target=_top href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2730782">Assessment of the Data Sharing and Privacy Practices of Smartphone Apps for Depression and Smoking Cessation</a>.  It's a fascinating read.  The study apparently did not want to call out which apps are guilty.  The goal was to examine how apps behave and characterize the overall landscape.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Here are the main results & conclusions, quoted directly from the study: </p>


<p class="entry">  `Results:  Twenty-five of 36 apps (69%) incorporated a privacy policy. Twenty-two of 25 apps with a policy (88%) provided information about primary uses of collected data, while only 16 (64%) described secondary uses. While 23 of 25 apps with a privacy policy (92%) stated in a policy that data would be transmitted to a third party, transmission was detected in 33 of all 36 apps (92%). Twenty-nine of 36 apps (81%) transmitted data for advertising and marketing purposes or analytics to just 2 commercial entities, Google and Facebook, but only 12 of 28 (43%) transmitting data to Google and 6 of 12 (50%) transmitting data to Facebook disclosed this.'</p>


<p class="entry"> `Conclusions and Relevance  Data sharing with third parties that includes linkable identifiers is prevalent and focused on services provided by Google and Facebook. Despite this, most apps offer users no way to anticipate that data will be shared in this way. As a result, users are denied an informed choice about whether such sharing is acceptable to them. Privacy assessments that rely solely on disclosures made in policies, or are not regularly updated, are unlikely to uncover these evolving issues. This may limit their ability to offer effective guidance to consumers and health care professionals.' </p>

 <p class="entry"> `In the modern age of Facebook, Google, and smart devices, most of us are under 24-hour surveillance. These data points are collected by large tech companies and are in turn sold to and used by governments and businesses alike to influence our behavior. On this week’s episode, Dr. Shoshana Zuboff discusses her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which explores what can be done to protect democracy and free thought against these new threats.
