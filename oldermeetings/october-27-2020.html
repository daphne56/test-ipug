<p class="entry"> It’s the season of new iPhones and iPads.  You can consider selling an old device or buying a gently used device. There are many choices: word of mouth, Apple, Craigslist, eBay, Swappa, and more.  </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple sells refurbished devices and also accepts old devices for trade-in and credit toward a new one. It’s an easy choice and it works well. </p>

<p class="topicTitle">podcasts</p>
	
	<p class="entry"> A recent episode of Sway by Kara Swisher is on  <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm/+he8HsJ_lE">The Man Behind America's Race for a Vaccine</a>. description: Dr. Moncef Slaoui is the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, and arguably the most powerful force in the mission to vaccinate America from the coronavirus. The scientist, a 30-year pharmaceutical industry veteran and registered Democrat, says he doesn’t “want to get into the politics” even though everything about the United States’ coronavirus response — from mask-wearing to President Trump’s illness — seems to have been politicized.
Dr. Slaoui says he’s an adviser with “significant influence” — not a decision maker. And while he makes no guarantee about vaccine timelines, he does stand by a commitment to quit if politics interferes with science, saying, “I can guarantee that I will say what I think, and I am saying what I think.”
