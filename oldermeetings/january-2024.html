<p class="topicTitle">privacy & security</p>



<p class="entry">  Remember a few months ago, when Joanna Stern of the WSJ reported on iPhone thieves that  broke into people's bank accounts by also stealing their iPhone passcode?  In many of those cases, the victims were also locked out of the iCloud/Apple account, in some cases permanently. It is an ingenious and dangerous scheme. This time, she found one of the thieves who is now convicted.  He agreed to  <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/he-stole-hundreds-of-iphones-and-looted-peoples-life-savings-he-told-us-how-fbd81ab5?mod=djemptech_t">be interviewed</a>, where he explains how he did it, in detail.  </p>


<p class="entry">  As Joanna notes, iOS 17.3 will provide an option to help reduce the likelihood of this scheme working, with a new setting: ` Stolen Device Protection' setting. This will make it much harder for thieves. But the weakest link is the human aspect: thieves can still trick you.   </p>

<p class="entry"> The article summarizes some advice:  </p>

<p class="entry"> 1). Add a passcode to money apps, such as Venmo and Cash App, and make each passcode unique. 2). Delete any notes or photos that include personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers. 3). Store that stuff in a secure note inside a third-party password manager, such as Dashlane or 1Password.   4). Create a stronger iPhone passcode, one that uses letters and numbers. 5). The most obvious is the thief's own advice: Watch your surroundings and don‚Äôt give your passcode out. </p>
