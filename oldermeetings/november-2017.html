<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>



<p class="entry"> iOS 11.1.1 has been released, including many new emoji.  </p>

<p class="entry">  A small thread critiquing  `dumpling' emoji implementations by various companies. No surprise on which is the best (click on the date below the quote to see the whole thread):</p>

	<p class="entry"> The iPhone X is out! Pre-orders started a few seconds past midnight on Oct 26 (officially Oct 27).  It is now available for sale at apple stores, online, and via the carriers, all of whom are offering incentives. </p>
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.imore.com/iphone-x-review">The Best Damn Product Apple Has Ever Made</a>: iPhone X, says iMore.  A review worth reading.  Very comprehensive. The reviewer concludes: `It's expensive. It's hard to get. It will take some getting used to. And it'll have its share of quirks. But it's not just tomorrow's iPhone today and it's not just the beginning of what comes next. It's the best damn product Apple has ever made. And it's the most fun I've had with any device since the original iPhone.'</p>

Put together with the Raise to Wake feature introduced with iOS 10, the natural act of lifting the iPhone X and glancing at it performs two tasks that used to require interaction: waking up the device and unlocking it. When I pull the iPhone X out of my pocket and look at it, it's already on and unlocked. I can decide what to do next.’ </p>



<p class="entry"> Yes, the iPhone X camera is great. Take a look at  <a target=_top href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-x-camera-review-guatemala">using an iPhone X camera on a trip to Guatemala</a>, by professional photographer Austin Mann. He also found some less talked about features, including Dolby Vision and improved mic. </p>

<p class="entry"> The review above is worth reading to get info on some changes: how to get the battery percent, reachability, and other gestures. </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> siri  calling Fronimos</p>

<p class="entry"> Recently, Olga asked Siri to call Fronimo’s to confirm our iPUG reservations.  She said `Siri, call Fronimos’. As we saw in our last meeting, hilarity ensued as Olga slowed down her speech pattern to help Siri understand which made matters worse. However, since upgrading to iOS 11, Siri understands the command and calls Fronimo’s easily. </p>

<p class="topicTitle">watch</p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/apple-watch-series-3-edition-review">A Week On The Wrist</a>: Apple Watch review of the Series 3 Edition watch.  Written by an expert on mechanical watches. This is a thorough review of the device and its impact on our lives as well as the marketplace.  Very highly recommended reading.  </p>


<p class="entry"> Among other things, the reviewer writes: `Series 3 has a barometric altimeter that measures, for the first time, relative elevation. That’s helpful for climbing stairs, skiing and snowboarding, hiking, etc. It has a new W2 wireless chip that was developed by, you guessed it, Apple, and offers better performance using less power. There is an entirely new processor within Series 3 that makes it up to 70% faster than Series 2. This is huge, and if you haven’t tried an Apple Watch since the first generation, you’ll be shocked by the differences in speed. Finally, the biggest change to Apple Watch Series 3 is that now, for the first time, it features cellular capabilities as a stand-alone device, meaning it can operate without your iPhone being within Bluetooth range. Doesn’t sound like a big deal? I didn’t think it was either, until I tried it.'</p>

<p class="entry"> He also writes: `I don’t know that I ever would’ve guessed I would say this about a smartwatch, but Apple Watch Series 3 might make your life better – you’ll be less connected with the digital world and more connected with the real world around you,” Clymer writes. “Apple Watch Series 3, Edition or not, is the watch we’ve been waiting for from Apple. As mentioned, the cellular capabilities alone elevate this product from a niche peripheral to something that could become instrumental to millions of people’s daily lives.’ </p>
