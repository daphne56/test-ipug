<p class="topicTitle"> WWDC updates </p>

<p class="entry">  Many news and updates on iOS 10, watchOS 3, MacOS, tvOS.   </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple <a target=_top href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2016/">has posted the entire Keynote</a> online. It's 2 hours long but it's easy to navigate or skip portions.</p>


<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 10 </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple has a  <a target=_top href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/">preview page for iOS 10</a> which will be released this fall. </p>

<p class="entry"> A long list of new  <a target=_top href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/15/accessibility-ios-10-macos-appletv-watch/">accessibility features in iOS 10</a>, reports 9to5Mac, including a very handy one to magnify small print. </p>

<p class="entry">  iOS 10 is compatible with iPhone 5 or later, iPad 4th gen or later, iPad mini 2 or later, and iPod Touch 6th gen. </p>

<p class="entry">  iOS 10 is `coming this fall'.  It's reasonable to expect it in mid-late September, based on previous years. </p>

<p class="entry">  Some key features: Apple has improved the lock screen. Siri is smarter and can now integrate with third-party apps. Computer vision analysis of your photos; if it works well, it will be useful to anyone who takes a lot of photos.  Most built-in system apps can now be removed from your device. Third-party VoIP apps will be able to show up on the lock screen when an incoming call arrives (only the native Phone and FaceTime apps can do this in iOS 9). Also, third-party messaging apps can be designated as the default for people , with different defaults for different people.
	
	<p class="entry">  Apple noted that the most used iOS app is iMessage.   <a target=_top href="http://www.popsugar.com/tech/iOS-10-iMessage-Details-41640477#photo-41640477">A list of new features</a> are coming to iMessage.</p>

	<p class="entry">  iOS 10 hidden new features  <a target=_top href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3089486/ios/5-hidden-ios-10-features-that-are-instant-game-changers.html"> that are instant game changers</a>, writes Macworld. </p>

	<p class="entry">  Though Siri will be available to 3rd party apps,  <a target=_top href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3083739/ios/siri-in-ios-10-will-only-work-with-six-types-of-third-party-apps-and-not-spotify.html">initially, it will work with just 6 types of apps</a>, points out Macworld. </p>

	<p class="entry"> In iOS 10, the Health app  <a target=_top href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3091757/ios/ios-10s-health-app-will-help-you-become-an-organ-donor.html">will help you become an organ donor</a>.  Apple's  <a target=_top href="http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/07/apple-and-donate-life-america-bring-organ-donation-to-iphone.html">announcement</a> highlights the challenge. `On average, one person dies every hour in the United States waiting for an organ transplant because the demand for lifesaving transplants far exceeds the available supply of organs - and one donor can save as many as eight lives,' said David Fleming, President & CEO of Donate Life America. `By working with Apple to bring the National Donate Life Registry to the Health app on iPhone, we're making it easier for people to find out about organ, eye and tissue donation and quickly register. This is a huge step forward that will ultimately help save lives.'</p>

	<p class="entry">  In an interview with the AP,  <a target=_top href="http://staging.hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_IPHONE_ORGAN_REGISTRY?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-07-05-03-02-36">Tim Cook talked about</a> Steve Jobs and his wait to receive a liver. `Watching and seeing him every day, waiting and not knowing - it stuck with me and left an impression that I'll never forget,' Cook said. Cook was so concerned that he offered to donate part of his own liver, although Jobs refused.</p>
 </p>


<p class="topicTitle">Mac </p>


<p class="entry">  `Mac OS X' is no more: the new name is `macOS'.  It is spelled as one word and with a lower case `m'.  Many reports have gotten this wrong. The next release will be Sierra (upgrading from El Capitan). </p>

<p class="entry">  Lots of new features were announced for Sierra.  <a target=_top href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-macos-sierra-features/">The top 5 new features</a>,  an overview by Digital Trends.  Universal Clipboard (across your devices), Siri on the Mac, unlock your Mac via Apple Watch, livelier iMessage, improved Photos app. </p>



<p class="topicTitle"> watchOS 3 </p>

<p class="entry"> WatchOS 3 is a significant upgrade.  Apple showcased major performance improvements with background refresh, favorite apps in memory, and instant launch. Also a significant redesign of the UI, with a dock (glances go away), with fewer steps to reply to messages, and with the new Scribbles.  Several new watch faces, including a greater focus on activity rings.   </p>

<p class="entry"> There is also a new  emergency call you can make from your watch.  Additionally, after the call, the watch will also automatically send a message to your emergency contact(s) with your location, and the watch will then show your medical ID, such as allergies, and so on.  This works internationally, even if you are traveling and do not know what the emergency number, your watch knows. </p>

<p class="entry"> The activity app is significantly expanded with sharing info and stats. There is also a  new watch face for those who want to focus on it.  The optional data sharing feature allows users to comment on each other's activity as a way to motivate each other.</p>

<p class="entry">  There is also a new app for watchOS called Breathe to guide you through deep breathing to improve daily health and relaxation. </p>

<p class="entry">  Additionally, Apple showed how they have improved and customized the activity app specifically for wheelchair users, adapting motion detection to the unique movement patterns and needs of those who use a wheelchair. </p>

<p class="entry"> For Mac users, the watch will provide authentication, so they can bypass having to type in a password to log into their Mac.</p>

<p class="entry">  Here's an overview <a target=_top href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3083906/wearables/watchos-3-faq-glances-are-going-away-as-watch-apps-speed-up-and-move-to-a-dock.html">of several new features coming with watchOS 3</a>, by Macworld. </p>

	<p class="entry">  Apple announced that with iOS 10, machine learning will be possible without compromising privacy.  Macworld  <a target=_top href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3089444/iphone-ipad/how-ios-10-powers-machine-learning-while-protecting-your-privacy.html"> gives an idea of the approach</a>. The main goal is to enable machine learning via pattern detection.  This helps with photo recognition of faces, improved spellcheck corrections, quick and relevant suggestions of emoji in text messages, and other smart features.  However, Google and others whose algorithms run on servers and may compromise your privacy, Apple aims to protect users.  Apple's implementation uses `differential privacy', a technique that adds noise to the data in order to protect your identity. </p>

Recall that this is the guy who accessed more than 300 personal Gmail and iCloud accounts, and got private photos and videos from targets including celebrities.  It's important to recall that this was not a Google nor Apple security breach; rather, the hacker used phishing techniques to guess passwords.  Another reminder to use unguessable passwords.  For example, your birthday and your street address are poor choices for passwords.</p>

The Android phones got infected by visiting certain websites. `The first component attempts to gain root access on a device with rootkit [software] that exploits multiple vulnerabilities. If successful, attackers gain full access to a device. If rooting fails, a second component uses a fake system update notification, tricking users into granting HummingBad system-level permissions.'  It's worth noting that a similar attack was made on iPhones a couple of years ago, but this was fixed with iOS 9 in 2015. </p>
