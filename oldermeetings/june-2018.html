<p class="topicTitle"> PSA</p>

<p class="entry"> Last week, the FBI  made an urgent request: <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/27/technology/router-fbi-reboot-malware.html">Reboot Your Router</a>. The NY Times reports: Hoping to thwart a sophisticated malware system that has infected hundreds of thousands of internet routers, the F.B.I. has made an urgent request to anybody with one of the devices: Turn it off, and then turn it back on.
The malware is capable of blocking web traffic, collecting information that passes through home and office routers, and disabling the devices entirely.' </p>

 <p class="entry">  With iOS 12, Apple  <a target=_top href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8ya4/apple-iphone-usb-restricted-mode-cellebrite-grayshift">is testing a feature that could kill police iPhone unlockers</a>, reports Motherboard. `It’s called USB Restricted Mode, and Apple has been including it in some of the iOS beta releases since iOS 11.3.
The feature essentially forces users to unlock the iPhone with the passcode when connecting it to a USB accessory every time the phone has not been unlocked for one hour. That includes the iPhone unlocking devices that companies such as Cellebrite or GrayShift make, which police departments all over the world use to hack into seized iPhones.' </p>


<p class="entry">  During the WWDC Keynote, Apple's Craig Federighi said that No, iOS apps will not run on the Mac.  However later he indicated that  <a target=_top href="https://www.wired.com/story/wwdc-2018-federighi-ios-apps-on-macos/">Apple has been working on this</a>. </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Privacy and security  core values for Apple. As reported by Loopinsight, at the WWDC they said:  </p>

<p class="entry"> `Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right, which is why iOS has always been designed with built-in encryption, on-device intelligence, and other tools that let you share what you want on your terms. And with iOS 12, we’re taking privacy even further. Safari now prevents Share buttons and comment widgets on web pages from tracking you without your permission. Safari also prevents advertisers from collecting your device’s unique characteristics, so they can’t identify your device or retarget ads to you across the web.' </p>

	<p class="entry"> With Apple’s dual-lens camera systems, combined with intelligent software, the camera can now create depth maps. This way it understands how far or how close each point in an image is from the camera. This enables  <a target=_top href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography">computational photography</a>, where depth of field, shadows and lights can be adjusted in a realistic fashion, after the photo was taken, as if it was set up before the photo was taken and the effects were achieved optically.

<p class="entry">  Do you ever need to fill out a PDF interactive form using Adobe Acrobat's Reader application?  Sometimes it's the only option you have.  The app is free but if you need to do anything else other than print to a physical printer, Adobe requires that you pay.  Sending the file to another person will also require that they get Adobe PDF reader.  This might not be easy (if the recipient is not tech savvy). Olga found herself in this situation.  Adobe Reader disables the Mac's `print-to-PDF' feature.  What can be done?</p>


<p class="entry"> Olga found  <a target=_top href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12055/print-to-pdf-with-adobe-reader/223923#223923">a wonderful tip that works</a>: you need to pause your physical printer, spoof Adobe to think it's really printing to a physical printer, then use the Mac's CLI to grab the hidden PS file that gets generated, and rename it as a PDF. </p>
