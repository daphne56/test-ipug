<p class="topicTitle"> the WORDLE craze</p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">WORDLE Is a Love Story</a>, reports the NY Times.  It's a word puzzle app that has taken the world by storm. </p>

<p class="entry"> The original and official  <a target=_top href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle app</a> is web-based and entirely free. You can save it as a bookmark on your homescreen and it acts like an app.</p>

<p class="entry"> Wordle is addictive but you are limited to one play per day. </p>

<p class="entry"> However, many apps suddenly appeared in the app store that are developed by people unrelated to the original inventor and creator.  Some developers who are unrelated to the original creator started to charge money, taking advantage of the game's immense popularity.  User beware. Stay away from such apps.</p>

<p class="entry"> There are also Wordle-like apps that are free that are poorly coded.  Some can use up CPU cycles and battery life that can make your iPhone need charging in the middle of the day.  </p>

<p class="entry"> The app  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzword-5-letter-word-puzzle/id1602799021">PuzzWord</a> is free and does not eat up your battery. It's essentially identical to Wordle but it doesn't pace you, so you can become completely addicted and play non-stop.  It may be wiser to use the original Wordle app.</p>

<p class="entry"> Meanwhile, many people post their daily solutions on Twitter.  Also, they discuss Wordle strategy.  An example (including the replies): </p>

	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://www.delicious-monster.com">Delicious Library</a> is a macOS application that lets you catalogue all your books quickly and easily.  It got an Apple design Award many years ago. There is a companion iOS app that lets you scan the book barcodes so you do not have to enter anything manually (although you may do so). You can scan several books in seconds.</p>
	
	
	
	<p class="entry"> Olga gave a demo of  <a target=_top href="https://www.delicious-monster.com">Delicious Library</a> and also showed  <a target=_top href="https://www.bruji.com/bookpedia/">Bookpedia</a> which is another app for cataloguing books. However, the iOS companion app for Delicious Library is far superior.</p>
	
		<p class="entry"> One of the new features that Apple's Notes app offers is `Quick notes' for iPadOS.  Additionally, a Quick note can grab links from other apps and place them easily in the note. You can find all these inside the folder Quick Notes in Notes and it syncs across all your devices via iCloud. This combination of Quick notes features makes Notes quite powerful. Olga gave a demo.  </p>
	
	
	
		
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://2ttf.com">iFontMaker</a> is an app for iPads.  It lets you create your own fonts. You can use it to turn your own natural handwriting into a font, or to create a fun calligraphy font, or anything else you like. You can use these fonts by installing them on your iPad or iPhone or on your Mac to use them in many applications.  For example,  to create a card or a `handwritten' note, a special poster for a party, a brochure that you want to personalize, and so on. You can also share your fonts with others and even license them and make them public. Olga gave a demo of iFontMaker.</p>

<p class="entry"> Olga uses the same Apple Pencil 2 with an iPad Pro and an iPad Mini. The pencil needs to be paired with one iPad at a time.  When switching iPad, the re-pairing process requires a a few seconds of contact, attaching the pencil onto the iPad as if you are charging it.  Olga reports that leaving it for a few extra seconds after the automatic popup message goes away is  a good idea.  </p>
