<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>
	
	<p class="entry"> Apple released iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and Watch Series 3 (with and w/o LTE). </p>

<p class="entry">  Apple now offers  <a target=_top href="http://mashable.com/2017/10/02/apple-iphone-payments-plan/#C1No9xGuOkqn">an additional option to purchase iPhones</a>, reports Mashable. `Apple iPhone Payments' lets you break down the price over 24 equal payments.  You do not need to buy through the carrier and sign up or extend a 2year contract.  This option is separate from the `iPhone Upgrade Program' which includes Apple Care Plus and lets the user upgrade their iPhone every year. </p>


<p class="entry"> A 12-year-old app developer was sent by Ellen degeneres to the Apple keynote event last month.  Here he is behind the scenes: </p>

<p class="entry"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I sent 12-year-old Alex Knoll to the Apple Keynote. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Tim_Cook</a> surprised him. <a href="https://t.co/QVp8hqq9cg">pic.twitter.com/QVp8hqq9cg</a></p>&mdash; Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/910216154039250944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>

<p class="entry"> The new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  <a target=_top href="https://browser.geekbench.com/ios-benchmarks">are ridiculously fast</a>, as show these benchmark scores.  Impressive.  In fact,  <a target=_top href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-8-iphone-x-vs-android-flagships-speed-tests-say-its-not-even-close/">compared to Android and Samsung Galaxy 8</a>, iPhone 8 is about 2x faster. </p>

<p class="entry"> The Face ID icon reminds us of something else: </p>

<p class="entry"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello old friend <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanKare">@SusanKare</a> <a href="https://t.co/tpvbH1DyEJ">pic.twitter.com/tpvbH1DyEJ</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Smith (@concreteniche) <a href="https://twitter.com/concreteniche/status/907700055817289728">September 12, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>

<p class="entry">  Today, Apple released iOS 11.0.2 which  <a target=_top href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3230487/ios/apple-releases-ios-11-0-2-update-that-fixes-static-during-facetime-and-phone-calls.html">fixes static noise during FaceTime and phone calls</a>, reports Macworld. </p>


<p class="entry"> For those considering the new iPhone X, remember that the best way to order one is to use the iOS Apple Store app, ensure you have a payment option all ready to go (Apple Pay is best but not required), save the model now as a favorite, and wait to order 1 second past midnight on Friday Oct 27 (that's really Thursday night Oct 26). </p>










<p class="topicTitle">new iTunes </p>


<p class="entry"> The new iTunes that was released a couple of days prior to iOS 11 took many by surprise: it eliminated the App store for iOS and the entire view of iPhone or iPad that syncs via iTunes.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Now,   <a target=_top href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/product-news/itunes-12-7/">restoring apps happens via the online app store</a>, directly from the iPhone or iPad, reports MacObserver.</p>

</p>


<p class="entry"> Finally, if you used iTunes to transfer files, now  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203106">you can use AirDrop</a>.  Apple has always favored a wireless approach and has said `the future is wireless’. </p>
