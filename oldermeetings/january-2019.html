<p class="topicTitle">iOS apps </p>
	
<p class="entry"> iPhone app of the year (2018):  <a target=_top href="https://procreate.art">Procreate Pocket</a>. Take a look  <a target=_top href="https://procreate.art/pocket">at the overview</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> The primary version is  <a target=_top href="https://procreate.art/ipad">Procreate</a>, the original app made for the iPad.  It's a professional-level app that can be used by mere mortals for fun. There are  <a target=_top href="https://procreate.art/support">lots of guides</a> to get you started.</p>

	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> is a 3rd party app for podcasts.  Olga recommends it highly.  If you enjoy podcasts, there is nothing better.  It has a companion watch app that is superb and solves several little annoyances  that Apple’s native app is plagued by (such as syncing only when plugged in, and very slowly, whereas Overcast does it faster and whenever you need it). </p>
	
	
	<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is a smart app to help you write notes and send them via email or text or just keep them.  Olga recommends it.   </p>
	
	<p class="entry"> Tip: If you have  Watch but you are not paying for independent internet service, Siri Reminders do not work when you are not near your iPhone.  This happens to Olga when she is out walking the dogs, wearing her watch without carrying her iPhone, and often wants to remind herself various things when she returns home. Drafts on the watch solves the problem by dictating  a quick reminder or even a longer idea.</p>
