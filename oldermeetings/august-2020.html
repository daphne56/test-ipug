<p class="entry"> Belkin is a company that makes a lot of gadgets for the iPhone and iPad ecosystem. They are  <a target=_top href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-BBM001/">now making disposable masks</a>. And they will soon offer <a target=_top href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-BBM003/">ComfortFit masks</a>.</p>

<p class="entry">  This `smart' mask  <a target=_top href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/smart-mask-can-translate-speech-into-8-languages/">Can Amplify the Speaker’s Voice and Translate Speech into 8 Languages</a>. `A Japanese robotics company has developed a smart mask that can amplify voices, transcribe dictation, and translate speech into eight different languages—and they will be available to the public as early as September.' </p>

<p class="entry"> How to think about masks, some smart advice: </p>

The new idea here is to add an alternate appearance to Face ID taken with your mask folded in half, covering one side of your face.   They write: `Thankfully there are some things you can do to give Face ID the best possible chance at working with a mask on, but it isn’t a science and even after following these steps we can’t guarantee that Face ID will behave correctly all the time. But hey, anything’s worth a shot if it could mean no more passcode entries, right?' (Note: Olga has not yet tested this.  It's worth some experimentation.)</p>

<p class="entry">  Meanwhile, New York City's MTA <a target=_top href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/mta-letter-to-apple-covid-19/">Urges Apple to Further Protect Riders During Pandemic</a>. `MTA Chairman Patrick Foye said riders have been seen removing their masks to unlock their iPhones using Face ID, despite a recent software update by Apple that makes it easier for masked users to enter their passcode instead.' </p>

The iPhone 12 is believed to be coming in 5.4", 6.7", and 6.1" sizes.  `While the rumored 5.4″ screen size is larger than the 4.7″ screen size of the iPhone 7/8, the removal of the Home Button from the body allows the overall device size to be smaller.', reports MacRumours.com. </p>

<p class="entry"> Sometimes friends ask for advice: should I buy a  mac now?  Should I wait? These questions have many possible answers, but this  <a target=_top href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#mac">Buyer's Guide</a> is always good to have. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is a tip for anyone who wants to prevent a kid or anyone from, say, messing up or deleting your iPhone photos. Set a passcode for Screen Time and then set a one-minute limit on the app you want to lock out (in this case, the Photos app).  Once you do that,  the photo app will be locked and can only be unlocked with your special screen time passcode.</p>

<p class="entry"> Here is how you do this: </p>

<p class="entry"> Settings > Screen time.  Set a passcode of your choice. </p>

<p class="entry"> Then go to App Limits. Add a Limit. Then select the Photo app (under Creativity).   </p>

<p class="entry"> Then choose 1 min.  </p>

<p class="entry">  From now on, the Photos app will work just like before, but it will require a passcode to access. </p>

<p class="entry"> You can apply the same trick to any app you want to restrict similarly. </p>
