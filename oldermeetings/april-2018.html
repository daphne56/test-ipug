	<p class="topicTitle"> Facebook, the meltdown </p>

<p class="entry"> This past month, Facebook’s `perfect storm’ became public. Though it seems FB itself has known about this since 2015. 50 Millions users' personal data and profile descriptions were given and taken by political consultants and used for political campaigns.</p>

<p class="entry">  Some reports refer to what has happened as a `data breach’. This is not accurate, or at best it’s misleading. Facebook enabled a breach of trust and an abuse that it set up and enabled with full awareness, despite warnings. Facebook did not have a security failure. What happened is consistent with FB’s business model: they collect a mountain of personal data from users, create detailed profiles based on user activity, and sell the info for profit to advertisers and other businesses. Many of these businesses create their own Facebook `apps’ that automatically collect the user’s personal data plus Facebook’s profile info, depending on each app.  </p>

<p class="entry"> In this case, Facebook provided an app all the data they had legitimately paid for.  The app also collected data from the friends of the users. (While this stretched the agreement that FB made with the app’s developers, this was easily enabled by Facebook’s own structures and business model.)  When Facebook learned about this (a couple of years ago), they merely sent a form to the developers asking them to confirm they deleted the extra data. Facebook did not ensure the data was ever deleted. The whole incident was kept quiet. Now that it is public, Facebook ousted the whistleblower. </p>
