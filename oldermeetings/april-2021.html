<h2>April 2021</h2>




<p class="topicTitle"> on current events</p>


 
 <p class="entry"> A year ago this month, we were on lockdown with a new pandemic. We held our first iPUG meeting via Zoom in April 2020.  </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  The beginning of the end is here: vaccinations are happening -- and accelerating in the US at a pace of 3+ Million shots a day across the country, some days over 4 Million/day. The US is on track to have all who are 16 or older eligible to be vaccinated earlier than planned, now by April 19. (This means those eligible can sign up starting April 19.)</p>
 
 <p class="entry"> The beginning of the end is here: The US rate of vaccinations is accelerating:  <a target=_top href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-04-05-21/h_1baa33ff53fef851892d5335932e470f">US vaccinating nearly 5 times faster than global average, according to CNN analysis</a>. </p>
 
 
 <p class="entry"> The beginning of the end is here:  The CDC has updated its guidelines. <a target=_top href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated</a>. This is a process. But life can be closer to `normal’ for those who are fully vaccinated.      </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> The beginning of the end is here: vaccines are proving to be even more effective than the scientific studies showed prior to their release.  </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  We are in a race between injections and infections. There is reason to feel optimistic.  This does not mean it's over -- not yet.  Sadly, there are increases in infections across many states again. We need to remain vigilant and continue precautions to stop the spread. </p>
 

 
 
 <p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-ok-to-be-optimistic-really-with-monica-gandhi/id1504128553?i=1000515794032">It's OK to Be Optimistic</a>: listen to this podcast, released yesterday. Dr. Bob Wachter calls up Monica Gandhi, infectious diseases and HIV doctor at UCSF, to talk about why she’s feeling optimistic at this moment in the pandemic. They discuss why her optimism hasn’t waned despite the fourth wave, the variants, and the CDC Director’s feeling of “impending doom.” Plus, why it’s so hard for places like the CDC to balance optimism and caution in how they advise the public.</p>
