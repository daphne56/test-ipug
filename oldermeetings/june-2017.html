He did not rule out making vehicles.  The focus is on autonomy and `electrification'.</p>

<p class="topicTitle"> WWDC announcements </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple has  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/">posted the entire WWDC Keynote (more than 2 hours)</a> on their website.</p>

<p class="entry"> Here is the WWDC in abbreviated version.  Instead of 132 minutes, this one is 19 minutes!  Worth watching. Go to min 8 to see iOS 11.</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXLa5tprhLc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> Tim Cook skipped the usual updates only to say `Apple is doing great'. They made 6 main announcements.   </p>

<p class="entry">  Regarding tvOS: Amazon is coming to the  TV app (on iPhone, iPad and Apple TV), as well as to all Apple TVs. This includes Amazon Prime Video. This includes original content, thousands of movies and TV Shows. `Later this year.'</p>

 <p class="entry">  Apple Watch is `by far' the number 1 selling smartwatch and number 1 in customer satisfaction, again. </p>

    <img src="../images/applewatchwwdc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="590" height="317"></a>
    
<br>
    
</p>

<p class="entry">Then they introduced watchOS 4. </p>


<p class="entry"> New watchface powered by Siri to give you relevant info you need, automatically, and to invoke Siri easily via complication on the upper left.  It's intelligent and proactive, using machine learning, much like on iOS. </p>




<p class="entry">  They also introduced a kaleidoscope face with `trippy' effects. ;-) </p>


<p class="entry">  They also showed more cartoon characters besides Mickey and Minnie, and they are animated: </p>

<p class="entry"> <br>

    <img src="../images/applewatchcartoonswwdc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="590" height="218"></a>
    


 <br> </p>
 
 
 <p class="entry">  Activity notifications are getting personalized to help motivate you to keep moving and increase your fitness goals. There will also be new monthly challenges.</p>
 
 <p class="entry">  The Workout app is enhanced significantly to be faster and easier to access, and with more capabilities and features.  There is a new High Intensity Interval Training workout choice, and the swimming workout tracks your laps better.</p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Also, watchOS 4 enables 2-way data exchange with gym equipment, for those who work out in a gym.  The technology requires NFC readers.  Example: data such as incline and speed can be sent from the equipment to your watch, and heart rate can be sent from the watch to the gym equipment.  This is supported by 80% of the gym equipment manufacturers.  Coming this fall. </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> The Apple Music app is being updated to automatically get your favorite music on the watch.   Navigate through the albums using the digital crown, tap and play easily.</p>
 
 
 <p class="entry"> And they also announced the ability to work with Bluetooth-based nearby gadgets for many new functions, including continuous glucose monitoring, or real-time swing analysis for tennis, or a gadget that connects to your surf board for wave analysis (!). </p>

<p class="entry">  Here is an  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/">overview and preview of watchOS 4</a> on Apple's website. </p>


<p class="entry">  News about iOS. Customer satisfaction is record-breaking: </p>


<p class="entry"> <br>

    <img src="../images/ioscustsatwwdc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="590" height="245"></a>
    
<br>
    
  </p>

<p class="entry">  And the install base blows away the competition: </p>

<p class="entry"> <br>

    <img src="../images/iosinstallwwdc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="590" height="237"></a>
    


 <br> </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  This has tangible consequences: developers and users can target the latest capabilities of the OS and have greater security. Android's fragmentation makes this impossible for 93% of the install base.</p>
 
 
 <p class="entry">  With iOS 11, many new features and improvements are coming soon. </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> The Messages app has been enhanced. Stickers are expanded and easier to access.  With iCloud sync, all devices automatically get and delete (!) the conversations your want or don't want, respectively.  They remain e2e encrypted. </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Apple Pay is the number 1 `contactless' payment method.  By the end of 2017, it will be accepted by 50% of ALL retailers in the US. </p>
 
 <p class="entry">  Apple Pay can be used (till now): via iPhone, via apps on iOS, via the web/Safari.  The last frontier: person-to-person.  It's integrated into the Messages app: </p>

  <p class="entry">  Siri is being used by 375 Million devices, over a course of a month. It is available in 21 languages.</p>
  
  <p class="entry">  With iOS 11, Siri's voice has used machine learning techniques to make the voice more human-like, with different intonations. There is a new interface and Siri will be able to ask more interactive questions and answers.  Also, it offers multiple results to your queries.  Finally, it has translation capabilities (beta).</p>
  
  
  <p class="entry"> With SiriKit, you can use Siri to carry out actions in 3rd party apps, such as Evernote, Things, WeChat, and so on. </p>
  
  <p class="entry"><br>

    <img src="../images/sirikitwwdc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="590" height="230"></a>
    
<br>
    
  </p>
  
  <p class="entry"> With new intelligence built in, Siri understands context, your voice, and understands what you want next. </p>
  
  <p class="entry">  Additionally, what Siri learns about you on one device, is synced across all devices, so you deal with your personalized Siri across all your devices. But it is private thanks to e2e encryption.  </p>
  
  
  <p class="entry">  Camera iOS updates.   Today, iOS users take 1 Trillion photos per year. With iOS 10, H.264 is the codec for videos, with iOS 11, it will be HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), providing up to 2x better compression.  Similar techniques are applied to JPG still images, effectively doubling the storage on the device and in iCloud.  Portrait mode has been enhanced significantly.</p>
  
  <p class="entry">  Control Center has been redesigned and enhanced. It's a single page.  Has 3d-touch.</p>

<p class="entry">  Apple  <a target=_top href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2017/6/initial-thoughts-on-ios-11-ipad-improvements">introduced a new Files app</a> that gives `pro' users access to a filesystem.  That's a first after many years of requests. </p>

<p class="entry"> A review of the new iPad pro by iMore:  <a target=_top href="https://www.imore.com/105-ipad-pro">a Beauty of a Beast</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="https://www.imore.com/should-you-get-ipad-pro">Should you upgrade?</a>  iMore helps you consider the options.  Their short answer: `If drawing and speed matter, Apple's new iPad Pro models are worth your money.' </p>

She concludes: `I love it. It's kind of a game changer. The colors are so much more vivid, they're brighter.

<p class="topicTitle">Travel tips </p>
	
	<p class="entry"> Carefully consider your mobile data usage before you travel internationally. Each provider offers different options and they have been changing a lot recently.  </p>
	
	<p class="entry">  Olga uses Verizon and recently chose to use their TravelPass option for travel to Greece.  It was an excellent option.  If you use a lot of data, it is probably the best deal offered by any provider. It costs $10/24hrs and lets you use `unlimited data', voice and texts.  </p>
	
	<p class="entry">  In this case, `unlimited' means either the max of your US-based plan (such as, 5GB/month, or whatever you have normally), or unlimited (if you have unlimited in the US).  However after 1/2 of GB of use, you get throttled to slow speeds. You might think that using 1/2 GB of data in 24 hours is a very generous ceiling, but it is  easier to get to this limit than it would be in the US, probably due to data usage being `additive' as multiple intermediary service providers get involved.  </p>
