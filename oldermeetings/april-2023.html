<p class="topicTitle">Cook interview by GQ </p>

<p class="entry">  Tim Cook  <a target=_top href="https://www.gq.com/story/tim-cook-global-creativity-awards-cover-2023">interviewed by GQ</a>.  `As Apple CEO, he has defied his skeptics and refashioned the world’s most creative company on his own exacting terms. Now, in a frank conversation, he offers new insight into his leadership—explaining why he sees himself as an outsider, how he asserts Apple’s values, and what he does to keep from staring at his iPhone all day.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) Also, Tim Cook discussed why Apple might  be interested in something like an AR/VR headset (without any confirmation of the rumors, of course): </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd): “If you think about the technology itself with augmented reality, just to take one side of the AR/VR piece, the idea that you could overlay the physical world with things from the digital world could greatly enhance people’s communication, people’s connection,” Cook says. “It could empower people to achieve things they couldn’t achieve before. We might be able to collaborate on something much easier if we were sitting here brainstorming about it and all of a sudden we could pull up something digitally and both see it and begin to collaborate on it and create with it. And so it’s the idea that there is this environment that may be even better than just the real world — to overlay the virtual world on top of it might be an even better world. And so this is exciting. If it could accelerate creativity, if it could just help you do things that you do all day long and you didn’t really think about doing them in a different way.”

Cook gestures at a glass pane nearby. We could measure it, he says, if we wanted to. We could put some art up on the wall, take a look at it right now. These were some of the very first AR uses people dreamed up, Cook says — imagine, in other words, what else might be possible, what else might already be invented and underway.' </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> Apple Music Classical</p>

<p class="entry">  Apple has released  <a target=_top href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music-classical/id1598433714">Apple Music Classical</a>.  It's a separate app from Apple Music and a free download.   </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple announced: `Apple Music Classical is designed for classical music. You can easily search works by artist, conductor, instrument, orchestra, and more. Plus, experience the highest quality audio available, up to 192kHz at 24-bit, and thousands of additional recordings in immersive Spatial Audio.

Watch as two of the most powerful talents in classical music, Alice Sara Ott and Karina Canellakis, join forces to introduce you to the new app with an exclusive performance of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 recorded in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos.

Apple Music Classical is included with Apple Music Individual, Student or Family Plan subscriptions at no additional cost. Now in the App Store.'    <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/03/apple-music-classical-is-here/">Read Apple's full announcement</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple has built <a target=_top href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apple-music-classical-app-3325c6ba">a better way of listening to Mozart and Beethoven</a>, reports the WSJ. [The problem `only exists because of a curious failure by the most successful music-streaming services. The problem was the way that classical music is categorized. The structure of classical music is completely different from pop music’s, which makes it extremely difficult for it to function in the streaming era. '</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Even the most sophisticated algorithms from the most technologically advanced companies are too clumsy to handle composers like Mozart and Brahms. That’s because they were made for individual artists like Bad Bunny and Madonna. If you want to hear a Bad Bunny song, it will be in your ears within seconds. If you want to hear a Brahms piano concerto, good luck. Try sifting through hundreds of recordings without a standardized format to track down one movement from a particular soloist who has performed it several times. You could listen to an entire Madonna album in the time it takes to find the right Mozart. ' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Apple Music Classical offers access to more than 20,000 composers, 115,000 works and five million tracks. If you search for Sibelius’s famous violin concerto, one tap brings you to a page with 314 options, including the five most popular recordings and one that Apple’s editors selected as their favorite, plus related pieces of repertoire chosen by classical specialists. It is the kind of smart human curation that shows how people can have a role in a world being conquered by generative artificial intelligence. Some of those recordings can be heard in high-resolution lossless and spatial audio, which is meant to re-create the sound quality of sitting in Carnegie Hall. ' </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> Apple Health app</p>


<p class="entry"> In iOS, the Health app has been growing over recent years and many new health dimensions can be tracked. Olga demoed some surprising aspects of mobility data. </p>

<p class="entry"> Also, the Health app in iOS offers the option to import lab data.  For example, results from blood tests done by Labcorp for your annual physical.  You can use the Health app to import all data and make comparisons across the years, or to understand trends, or reference them during a doctor's visit.  This works much better than having an infinity of `portals' to a variety of clinics and different medical practices.   </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga gave an update on her smart doorbell by Wemo. Recall that she bought it last summer and it worked very well.  Recently it started going offline frequently and eventually Wemo Support offered a new one as a replacement. However the replacement had the same behavior.  Wemo Support was excellent and very thorough.  They eventually recommended checking the transformer:  the house's transformer for the house's chime (unrelated to Wemo).  The electrician Olga brought checked the transformer and even though it seemed to be working OK, he suggested replacing it because when these get old they start to fail.  The new transformer fixed the issue. So the original Wemo doorbell was probably fine and did not need replacement.  Olga reports that the overall experience with Wemo support was thorough, patient, and very professional.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Apple Watch  <a target=_top href="https://www.myhealthyapple.com/apple-watch-predicting-pain/">could help with predicting pain in people with Sickle Cell Disease</a>, according to a recent research study.  The pain in intense and is the primary reason for hospitalization for those with sickle cell disease.  The study showed the feasibility and the potential to use data collected from an Apple Watch to predict pain to help avoid hospitalization. The Watch provides an inexpensive and non-invasive method and  <a target=_top href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36917171/">the study showed an accuracy of 84.5%</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-researchers-use-ai-to-detect-weak-heart-pump-via-patients-apple-watch-ecgs/">Mayo Clinic researchers use Apple Watch</a> ECG data analysis with AI to detect weak heart pumps. </p>

<p class="entry">  (cont'd)  "Left ventricular dysfunction — a weak heart pump — afflicts 2% to 3% of people globally and up to 9% of people over age 60. It may have no symptoms, or be associated with shortness of breath, leg swelling or racing heart beats. What is important is that once we know a weak heart pump is present, there are many lifesaving and symptom-preventing treatments available. It is absolutely remarkable that AI transforms a consumer watch ECG signal into a detector of this condition, which would normally require an expensive, sophisticated imaging test, such as an echocardiogram, CT scan or MRI,"  <a target=_top href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-researchers-use-ai-to-detect-weak-heart-pump-via-patients-apple-watch-ecgs/">says Paul Friedman, M.D., chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>.</p>

He described being a good user of his Watch for tracking workouts and more.  However, his watch notified him that his average breaths per minute rose.  He went to the doctor and was given medications for bronchitis.  Then, he got another watch alert that his blood oxygen had dropped to 85%. He went to the ER where a CT scan showed he had blood clots all over his lungs. "What the doctor said as a follow-up was it if I hadn't gone in, he said 60% of the people that have this condition at that stage—if I gone to bed, I may not have woken up the next morning," Counihan said.</p>


<p class="entry"> And recently, a German driver's Apple Watch  <a target=_top href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/14/apple-watch-crash-detection-leads-medics-to-car-thrown-60-feet-below-road">helped rescue him</a> after his car crashed and fell off the road about 60 feet below the roadway.  It was so far into the bushes that it was not recognizable from the road. `However, the Apple Watch worn by one of the car's occupants led police, fire brigade, and four ambulances directly to the site. After the fire brigade diverted traffic and made safe the descent to the steeply sloping terrain, rescue workers were able to treat the occupants', reports AppleInsider.</p>
