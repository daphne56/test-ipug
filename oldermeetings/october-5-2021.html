<p class="topicTitle"> Steve Jobs</p>



<p class="entry"> Today, October 5, 2021, is the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs' passing.   <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com">Today's Apple homepage</a> has a tribute, including a short video and a statement from his family: </p>

<p class="entry">  Also worth remembering how Tim Cook dedicated the new Steve Jobs Theater, using a recording of Steve Jobs' own words about making things with `a great deal of love:' </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> Apple and iOS news</p>
 
 
Apple held the September event on Sept 14, 2021.  Here is the whole event (1 hour + 18 mins).  The video is chapterized, so you can skip to the parts you want: iPad, iPad mini, Apple Watch, apple Fitness+, iPhone 13 (2 models, regular and mini), iPhone 13 Pro (2 models, Pro and Pro Max).

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvGOlAkLSLw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is the event in 7 mins, summarized by MacRumors, focusing on the newly redesigned iPad Mini, new iPhone 13 family, new Apple Watch Series 7: </p>


<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAGserJzWBA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>


<p class="entry"> iPad mini 6 </p>

<p class="entry"> The new iPad mini 6 is redesigned and looks like the iPad Air that was introduced earlier this year. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is Apple's  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/">overview of the new iPad mini</a>. </p>

<p class="entry">  The new iPad mini has the bionic A15 chip, a USB-C connector, supports the apple pencil gen2, and offers 5G cellular optional connectivity. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is an <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/">iPad comparison page</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Some people have complained that the new iPad mini has `jelly scroll.'  This is generally common with LCD displays, but some users say they see it more on the new mini.  Others do not see it.  As it turns out, it depends on the user's reading speed and screen orientation.  The best explanation  <a target=_top href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad+Mini+6+Teardown/145085">is provided by iFixIt</a>, see video starting at 49 seconds: </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJQiu6TTx94?start=49" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> Olga reports getting a new iPad mini and loving it.  She does not encounter any jelly scroll because she does not speed-read. :-) </p>




<p class="topicTitle"> iPhone 13 </p>

<p class="entry"> Yes, the iPhone 13 and the  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/">iPhone 13 Pro</a> are here.</p>

<p class="entry">  You can compare all 4 new models  <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/specs/"> side by side</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> The reviews are in, the new iPhone 13 family gets high marks.   <a target=_top href="https://www.imore.com/iphone-13-review">Pinnacle of the mainstream</a>, says iMore, praising the significant battery life boost and the cameras. </p>





<p class="entry"> iPhone 13 cases </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is a nice online tool  <a target=_top href="https://iphonestudio.app">iPhoneStudio.app</a> that lets you visualize how a case will look on an iPhone 13. </p>

<p class="topicTitle"> ProMotion on iPhone 13 Pro </p>


<p class="entry">  Apple Quietly Included a Remarkable Feature in the iPhone 13 Pro, reports Inc: <a target=_top href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apple-quietly-included-a-remarkable-feature-in-iphone-13-pro-it-makes-all-difference.html">ProMotion isn't just about fast refresh and smooth scrolling</a>: </p>


<p class="entry"> `It takes a lot of energy to light up and refresh that display, so the fewer times it has to redraw what you’re looking at, the better. Other devices with high refresh rates might adjust based on what is showing on the display. For example, if you’re watching a film shot at 24 frames per second, the display might refresh at 24 or 48Hz. If you’re playing a game, it might refresh at 120Hz.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `On the iPhone, that’s still true, but Apple took it further by quietly included a remarkable way of deciding what refresh rate to use. Your iPhone 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max literally measures the speed of your finger on the screen, and then adjusts the refresh rate of the display.'</p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd) `Reading a tweet, the iPhone 13 Pro drops down to 10Hz. If you start to scroll slowly, it might choose a faster refresh rate, say 60Hz. If you scroll quickly, it can ramp up to 90 or 120Hz. Apple doesn’t say exactly how many different refresh rates the display uses, only that it designed the system to match the refresh rate to the speed of your finger.' </p>








<p class="topicTitle"> iPhone 13 photography & video</p>

<p class="entry"> For the first time this year, Apple put together a short video Guided Tour comparing all 4 models of iPhone 13 (7 mins), and many (most) of the features they spotlight are related to photography.  The video is chapterized.  </p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72cAe_2LAFQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry">  All 4 models of the new iPhone 13 family share some new photography features: the new Cinematic mode, improved low light photo performance, and the new `photographic styles', ceramic shield, A15 bionic chip,  5G, and significantly longer battery life.</p>

<p class="entry"> The Pro and Pro Max models also offer:  Super retina XDR display with ProMotion, macro photography, 3x optical zoom on the telephoto lens.  </p>


<p class="entry"> Here is a fun video demo by apple showcasing Cinematic mode  (1 min + 27 secs):</p>

<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Tl1RL8MRCA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p class="entry"> And here is a video created by 2x Oscar winning Director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser,  using the new iPhone 13 Pro.  They showcase some of the new features, including: Cinematic mode,  low-light video performance,  stabilization, 3x optical zoom, macro video and ProRes (3 mins):</p>


<p class="entry"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3CZX-lnAIc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>



<p class="entry"> And of course, pro photographer Austin Mann has published his  <a target=_top href="https://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-13-pro-camera-review-tanzania">iPhone 13 Pro camera review</a> all the way from Tanzania, with some beautiful examples of the new camera capabilities.  He concludes with buying advice and `an image that says it all.'`</p>








<p class="topicTitle"> how to sell older devices</p>

<p class="entry"> If you are trying to make room for new devices, here is what you could do with the older ones: </p>

<p class="entry"> Gift them to someone who will appreciate them: friends, or family, or donate them. </p>

<p class="entry"> If you want to sell them, Apple gives you instant credit when you purchase a new device.  They even give credit for non-Apple devices, such as Androids. </p>





<p class="entry"> Consider  <a target=_top href="https://www.sellcell.com">SellCell.com</a>.  They do meta-comparisons of all the 3rd party businesses who can buy older devices from you. With SellCell you will have an extensive comparison of offers for your used device.  Worth noting: One company might have better offers for, say, your old iPhone, and a different company might be better for your old iPad.  </p>


<p class="entry"> Another option is to sell it on  <a target=_top href="https://swappa.com">Swappa.com</a>.  It's worth comparing recently sold prices on Swappa vs. SellCell.com to see if the extra legwork of selling on your own is worth it to you.  </p>




<p class="topicTitle"> iOS 15</p>



<p class="entry"> Here are some significant new features.</p>
