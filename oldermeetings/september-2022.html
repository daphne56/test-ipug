<p class="entry"> You can order the new iPhones starting tomorrow, Friday, Sept 9, at 5 am Tucson (PT). However, you can actually set up your purchase on the Apple Store app and have it ready to place the order with just one click, any time after 5 am tomorrow.  This means you can go through the purchasing options in advance and save them: the carrier verification, any trade-in, the payment option of your choice, etc.  This avoids delays and snafus when everyone is trying to place an order at the same time. </p>
