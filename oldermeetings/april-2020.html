<p class="topicTitle"> Zooming to avoid COVID-19</p>



<p class="entry"> A few thousand years ago, it seems (i.e., last month), our iPUG meeting was held at Fronimo's.  Welcome to our Zoom meetings, starting this month. Welcome to our remote members who can now join from afar.</p>

    <a target=_top href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/thursday-march-26th-earth-moon-social-distancing"><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e7cb4ff9b2ebc0008405829/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/A24050-dailycartoon.jpg" alt="cartoon" width="560" height="533"></a>
    
<br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.6em;"> “That’s close enough.”   <br>  </p>
	<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.7em;"><a target=_top href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/thursday-march-26th-earth-moon-social-distancing"> [New Yorker cartoon by Avi Steinberg.] </a>  




<p class="entry"> Thank you to Logan, Lee, Roger,  Bernie,  and  all who sent links regarding Zoom security and privacy shortcomings. Zoom has grown by about 20x in the past few weeks. It would be surprising if they did not experience challenges.  They are trying to improve security and keep up with demand.  Meanwhile, it's OK to use Zoom for gatherings such as iPUG, book clubs, social meetings, etc. Our iPUG meeting requires an invitation and the host manually accepts participants to join. This resolves most of the recent Zoom problems other meetings have experienced.  Here is  <a target=_top href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-teleconferencing-and-online-classroom-hijacking-during-covid-19-pandemic">the FBI warning about recent problems with Zoom meetings</a>.</p>

<p class="entry"> For  conversations requiring  assured privacy and security, FaceTime audio or video is a better choice, as it is end-to-end encrypted.  FT video calls have a limit of 10 people. FT audio calls have a limit of about 100 people.</p>

<p class="entry"> See additional info in the privacy & security section below. </p>







<p class="topicTitle"> reliable info during the pandemic</p>

<p class="entry"> Scams are on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Its good to remain skeptical of claims that sound too good to be true: miraculous supplements to avoid getting sick, money-making schemes, and more. </p>

<p class="entry">  The IRS <a target=_top href="https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact.shtml#COVID">offers ways to report scams</a> claiming to be IRS-related. </p>

<p class="entry"> For information, go to trusted sources:  <a target=_top href="https://www.cdc.gov">The CDC</a>,  <a target=_top href="https://covidtracking.com">The COVID Tracking Project</a>, and mainstream news organizations.  </p>

<p class="entry">  Also, this is crowdsourced, so take it with a grain of salt,  but can be useful, especially in light of the absence of COVID-19 test kits. <a target=_top href="https://covidnearyou.org/#!/">COVID near you</a> crowdsources info to track the progress of coronavirus.</p>




<p class="topicTitle"> creativity during lockdowns</p>

<p class="entry"> Some new ways people and businesses have shared their ideas and new creations:  </p>


<p class="entry"> Arizona Theatre Company offers their recent play via live-streaming  <a target=_top href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/gmcb">or watching the production online</a> afterwards. </p>

<p class="entry"> Many museums are offering online views of exhibits: </p>

<p class="entry"> The MoMA in New York is  <a target=_top href="https://www.moma.org">offering exhibits and education</a> via their website.</p>

<p class="entry"> The Imagination Library  <a target=_top href="https://imaginationlibrary.com/goodnight-with-dolly-read-aloud/">Presents "Goodnight with Dolly"</a>.  This is a weekly offering, with Dolly Parton.  She reads books from the Imagination Library to children and families. </p>

<p class="entry">  The Getty Museum in Los Angeles asked people <a target=_top href="https://www.sadanduseless.com/recreated-art/">To Recreate Paintings With Stuff They Can Find at Home, Here Are The Results</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> Many restaurants are now take-out only, including  <a target=_top href="https://www.fronimos.com">Fronimo's</a>. The Feast restaurant on Speedway is offering food for take-out with curbside pick-up and is also  <a target=_top href="https://www.eatatfeast.com/events/categories/wine/">offering their popular wine tastings via Zoom</a>.</p>

<p class="entry">  For those who are new to working remotely, the good people at Take Control Books are offering  the e-book<a target=_top href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/working-from-home/">Working from Home Temporarily</a> for free to all. </p>

<p class="entry"> Here are Lee and Petra, our very own iPUG members, interviewed by KOLD on <a target=_top href="https://www.kold.com/2020/03/30/counselors-say-how-keep-relationships-strong-during-covid-/">how to keep relationships strong during COVID-19</a>. </p>

<p class="entry"> All of us are grappling with the realities of lockdowns, trying to stay healthy, trying to remain calm and hopeful during this challenging time. It's good to help each other as best we can: help a neighbor or someone in need, help  local businesses survive.  It's good to remember that though there are some tough weeks ahead, this is finite and will end. And in the meantime, meetings such as our monthly iPUG gathering can continue and bring us joy. </p>

<p class="topicTitle">privacy & security</p>
	

<p class="entry"> Zoom is facing unending, explosive demand and growth, due to the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p class="entry"> Zoom is now afflicted by security issues, with reports of attacks that can take over Windows machines and Macs, and lots of trolling Zoom-bombing (where an uninvited person joins a conference, frequently harassing the rest of the attendees). </p>


<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">Zoom video calls are not end-to-end encrypted</a>, writes Matthew Green, a cryptographer and computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University.  Zoom video cals can be very useful, especially now with COVID-19. However, `when you have a Zoom meeting, the video and audio content will stay private from anyone spying on your Wi-Fi, but it won’t stay private from the company’, writes Green.  </p>

<p class="entry"> Here is  <a target=_top href="https://tidbits.com/2020/04/03/every-zoom-security-and-privacy-flaw-so-far-and-what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself/">Every Zoom Security and Privacy Flaw So Far, and What You Can Do to Protect Yourself</a>. </p>



<p class="entry"> Zoom  <a target=_top href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/">responds to the security issues</a>: </p>

<p class="entry"> `Usage of Zoom has ballooned overnight – far surpassing what we expected when we first announced our desire to help in late February. This includes over 90,000 schools across 20 countries that have taken us up on our offer to help children continue their education remotely. To put this growth in context, as of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, conducted on Zoom was approximately 10 million. In March this year, we reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid.' </p>

<p class="entry"> (cont'd): `We recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s – and our own – privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry, and I want to share what we are doing about it.' </p>

<p class="entry"> While Zoom is working hard to meet the demand and deliver fixes,  <a target=_top href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202945/zoom-alternative-conference-video-free-app-skype-slack-hangouts-jitsi">Here are some alternatives</a>, compiled by The Verge. 
</p>

<p class="entry"> However, the best and easiest choice for iOS users is FaceTime Audio or Video. The only downside is that video is limited to 10 people.</p>




<p class="topicTitle">iPUG meetings frequency </p>

<p class="entry"> During the stay-at-home orders and until we get back to our usual f2f meetings, is there interest in holding iPUG meetings more often?  Such as on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month? </p>
