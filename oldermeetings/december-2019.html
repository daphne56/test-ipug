This year's ad is focused on the iPad, which plays a central role in the family’s holiday experience. But what begins as a convenient distraction becomes something far more powerful in the hands of the two young girls', writes AdSense.</p>

<p class="entry"> Apple’s own Smart Battery cases  for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max each features a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video. It works for selfies, too.There’s no camera button on the iPhone itself. <a target=_top href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/this-x-ray-teardown-really-smarts-iphone-11-smart-battery-cases">iFiit did an investigation</a>, since there is no such button on iPhone itself. `There are no buttons on the iPhone 11 that match up with the camera on the case. Our first guess was some kind of wireless transmission to the phone, but then we saw our patient’s X-rays. It turns out there’s a little circuit board inside the case, which has a thin, flexible circuit running out to connect to the photo button. That circuit board connects the camera button to the phone through the Lightning port “chin” at the bottom of the case. Not totally unexpected, but interesting to see how much hardware design goes into adding just one thing to a battery case.' </p>

But when the three robbers realized they couldn’t unlock the phone, they turned their black Nissan Sentra around. They demanded that the off-duty Coral Springs firefighter unlock it. He refused. They shot him dead. Ultimately, it was the robbers’ back and forth on the road that night that would help detectives crack the case: A combination of cellphone data and license plate readers led them to their murder suspects, two sources with knowledge of the case told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.` </p>

It’s possible that Ring still wasn’t on your radar earlier this year, when reports emerged that the home security giant had partnered with scores of police departments, funneling videos and user data in some dystopian effort to make a profit by fighting crime and eradicating privacy. But there’s a good chance that you’re going to see a Ring video doorbell on sale—possibly bundled with an Amazon Echo—this Black Friday. Do not buy it. And definitely don’t buy one for somebody else.'</p>
