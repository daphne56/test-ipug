<p class="topicTitle">iOS & Apple news</p>
	<p class="entry">  iOS 10.2.1 has been released.   </p>

<p class="entry">  Meanwhile, Apple  <a target=_top href="http://www.cultofmac.com/464016/everything-new-ios-10-3/">gave an overview to developers of 10.3</a>, to be released in the near future.  It packs a lot of features. Take a look:</p>

[ . . . ] The right question is what does a computer in 2017 need to be? '  </p>
  
  
  <p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/31/aapl-q1-2017">Apples 1Q2017 financial results</a> show it has returned to growth, reports John Gruber. `The Company posted all-time record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion.'  iPhone continues to be the dominant revenue source. Services are up significantly. </p>
  
  <p class="entry">  Here are all the results  <a target=_top href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/01/apples-record-quarter-by-the-numbers/">in pretty graphs</a>, compiled by SixColors. </p>
  
  <p class="entry">  The only product whose revenue decreased was the iPad.  John Gruber speculates  <a target=_top href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/31/cooling-ipad-sales">on reasons why</a>, including the idea that the replacement cycle is slower that the iPhone's: many people replace their iPhone every 1-2 years. Fewer replace their iPad as often.</p>
  
  <p class="entry"> Tim Cook's remarks about the Watch: `It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch -- both units and revenues -- with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world, and also the most-loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it's the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.' </p>
  
  <p class="entry">   <a target=_top href="http://www.imore.com/who-watches-apple-watch-watchers">It's time to admit Apple Watch is a success</a>, Renee Ritchie writes or iMore.  Additionally, John Gruber argues we <a target=_top href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/31/ritchie-apple-watch">should stop referring to `smartwatches'</a>, just consider `Apple Watch' a watch.  `In September, Apple claimed watch revenues second only to Rolex. How can it not be considered a hit at this point? '</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  








<p class="topicTitle">What is VPN ?</p>

<p class="entry"> What is VPN and why do you need it? </p>

<p class="entry"> VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.  It adds a layer of security to protect data you send and receive over a network.  It is especially useful when you are using public WiFi's, such as coffeeshops or other public wireless access points that are often not protected.  Additionally, even when you use a private network, you might still prefer to have the extra security of a VPN; for example, if you want to access sensitive personal data while visting a friend's house and using their WiFi whose setup might not be very secure. </p>



<p class="entry">  With VPN, data is packaged and encrypted.  If someone intercepts data your are sending or receiving, the data will not be decipherable. </p>


<p class="entry"> VPN provides security at three levels: data encryption (what you send or receive),  authentication (to prevent unauthorized users to enter the network), and message integrity (to detect any tampering of data transmission).</p>

<p class="entry">  Additionally, a VPN can often be used to get around  geographical restrictions and/or censorship, or to connect to proxy servers to hide your  identity and location. Some VPNs compress data for faster transmission, especially for mobile devices.</p>

<p class="entry">  Here is a review of how personal VPN services work: </p>

<br>
    
Data access with VPN.

 <br>  </p>


<p class="entry">  What are the downsides to using a VPN? Two aspects to consider: impact to performance (and consequently also to battery life, for mobile devices), and the need to trust a 3rd party.  Performance impact is generally minimal when using a good VPN service, but you should also look into how many servers they have globally or near you. The VPN company you are using must be one you trust: a) to implement a secure design (to be technically competent), and b) to be honest and not access or share any data (remember: your data gets decrypted by the VPN company). Many VPN companies do not log your activities.  Check how their privacy policy and how they respond to requests for data.</p>

<p class="entry">  What are good uses o VPN? Examples such as: you are at a public WiFi and want to access your email, or want to send a document. You want to search for information about, say, a health condition, without having your ISP know you are doing so. (However, a VPN will not protect you if you access personal financial info or make a purchase online without HTTPS connection.) VPN does not protect you from everything, but it does protect you from a lot o common uses.</p>

<p class="entry"> Do I really need a VPN? It depends on how you feel about data security and privacy. For example, if you use public WiFi's, and access your email, you need a VPN to protect your data. (If you only read newspapers and consistently avoid reading or sending emails, you might care less.) If you do not want to let your ISP (Internet Service Provider such as Cox or Comcast) know about every internet search you do, even at home, your online browsing habits and so on, you might want to use a VPN. If you travel abroad, you might want to use a VPN to access data that is only available to you in the US.</p>

<p class="entry">  Worth noting: Corporate VPNs protect access to company data; however, employees who have a company VPN do not get any protection in their personal use of the rest of the internet.</p>

<p class="entry">  Also worth noting: some communication services come with end-to-end encryption built in.  For example, iMessage between iOS users has E2E encryption and is safer than most email services. So you can safely use iMessage in a public WiFi without concerns.</p>

<p class="entry"> Should you use a free VPN?  Free is often not a good deal (think about trust mentioned above). Things to consider: what is their business model?  Free services often do not last. We need to pay and support services we want to depend on. On the other hand, if a free offer is part of a `freemium' plan, this may be a good deal.  Companies often offer a free version for you to test with the hopes that you will upgrade.  That's worth considering. </p>

<p class="entry"> Should you use a VPN that offers a lifetime purchase? Things to consider: very few things last a lifetime, especially company services. How likely is a company going to outlive your lifespan or your VPN needs? You may be better off going with a VPN company you trust and has been around a few years, but does not make lifetime promises. </p>
