<p class="topicTitle"> messages & spam </p>

<p class="entry"> Last month, we discussed how to deal with excess spam. This month Olga provided additional info of what has worked well for her, using iOS 17 tools. </p>

<p class="entry"> Problems to be solved: Spam text messages.   Spam phone calls.  An overwhelming volume of these (at times). The problems with these stem from being reachable via a cellphone number and/or reachable via other means (such as an email address), getting  text messages especially at sensitive times such as when you are traveling overseas (when daytime spam becomes night-time abroad), or when you are in the middle of an important meeting.  The same challenges apply to spam calls. </p>

<p class="entry"> For your Messages, you can have iOS filter  them into known and unknown senders. Go to Settings > Messages > Filter Unknown Senders.  Then view only known senders, most of the time.  Every so often, at your convenience only, you can go to Unknown Senders and get rid of what you don't want. You can also use the `Report Junk' option we discussed last month.   </p>

<p class="entry"> Keep in mind that sometimes Unknown Senders are not spam, such as when you get verification texts and similar. But this filtering approach helps you buffer the onslaught. </p>


<p class="entry"> If you are in an important meeting and do not want distractions or interruptions, you can use the DND Focus in iOS. </p>

<p class="entry"> If you get many spam phone calls on your iPhone, you can have iOS divert them to your voice mail automatically.  Go to Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers. </p>

<p class="entry">  Note that this works really well for most cases, but every once in a while you might miss a call you want because it's coming from an unknown number.  For example, say you are expecting a callback from a doctor. And naturally, you don't want to have to continuously turn on/off the option to silence unknown calls.  Remember to: </p>

<p class="entry">  <a target=_top href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105066?cmdf=ios+17+live+transcript+voice+mail">Use Live Voicemail on your iPhone</a>. Settings> Phone > Live Voicemail.  Once enabled, if you get a call from a doctor who is using an unknown phone number, the call will be silenced, but if you watch for the live transcript, you can pick up the phone immediately.</p>

<p class="entry"> The WaPo reports on  <a target=_top href="https://wapo.st/4a08SwZ">How to Talk to an AI</a>.  </p>
 

<p class="entry"> Tech companies remind employees: Cyber Criminals Use Artificial Intelligence Too. Artificial Intelligence improves security protections for organizations, but at the same time, cyber criminals are using Artificial Intelligence to improve their tactics to bypass those protections. Cyber criminals use AI and machine learning to generate highly targeted and convincing phishing emails, text messages, spoof voices of senior executives and conduct other social engineering attacks. Grammar mistakes and typos are no longer ways to detect potential phishing emails. Cyber criminals also use AI to create more effective password cracking algorithms that guess passwords with greater accuracy and speed, which reinforces the importance that we use long, complex passwords that are not based on publicly available information available such as social media.
