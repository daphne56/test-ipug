 <p class="topicTitle">Apple Music </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> Apple announced that Apple Music will now offer  2 new features: <a target=_top href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">Lossless audio and Spatial Audio</a>.  This started in  June 2021 at no additional cost, a feature for all Apple Music subscribers.  This will apply to the entire catalogue.</p>
 
 <p class="entry"> Some highlights: </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> Apple announced: `Apple Music is bringing industry-leading sound quality to subscribers with the addition of Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Spatial Audio gives artists the opportunity to create immersive audio experiences for their fans with true multidimensional sound and clarity. Apple Music subscribers will also be able to listen to more than 75 million songs in Lossless Audio ‚Äî the way the artists created them in the studio. These new features will be available for Apple Music subscribers starting next month at no additional cost.‚Äô </p>
 

 
 <p class="entry"> `By default, Apple Music will automatically play Dolby Atmos tracks on all AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as well as the built-in speakers in the latest versions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac.‚Äô </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> Regarding the 2nd feature in this announcement, Apple said: `Apple Music will also make its catalog of more than 75 million songs available in Lossless Audio. Apple uses ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) to preserve every single bit of the original audio file. This means Apple Music subscribers will be able to hear the exact same thing that the artists created in the studio.' </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> `To start listening to Lossless Audio, subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music can turn it on in Settings > Music > Audio Quality. Here, they can choose different resolutions for different connections such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. Apple Music‚Äôs Lossless tier starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz (kilohertz), and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz and is playable natively on Apple devices. For the true audiophile, Apple Music also offers Hi-Resolution Lossless all the way up to 24 bit at 192 kHz.‚Äô </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> `Due to the large file sizes and bandwidth needed for Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless Audio, subscribers will need to opt in to the experience. Hi-Res Lossless also requires external equipment, such as a USB digital-to-analog converter (DAC).‚Äô </p>
 
 <p class="entry"> The new experience will be available to all subscribers at no extra cost, even for High-res lossless.  The latter will require a special adapter to enjoy.   </p>

<p class="entry"> These two camera tricks are very nice, especially if you are in a hurry. (Note that these were included in the longer video demo in the Photography section above.  The video in the earlier section includes more photo tips than just these 2 quick tips): </p>

<p class="entry"> Bring up the camera in photo mode. Tap the shutter button and drag  to the right.  You will see a second button appear.  As soon as it appears,  just let go, and now you are recording a video. [This tip is very useful if your default start for camera is in picture mode.] </p>

<p class="entry"> Bring up the camera in photo mode. Touch and drag the shutter button to the left.  Now you are taking photos in burst mode. (Note: do not linger when you tap, just tap and immediately start to drag left.)  </p>
