<p class="topicTitle">podcasts</p>
	
	<p class="entry">  Recall that Wiser Than Me won Best Podcast of the year last year. Now it has started its 2nd season.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus interviews women in their 70's, 80's, and 90's about life and the wisdom they have accumulated.  The interviews are wise, funny and often irreverent.     <a target=_top href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/julia-gets-wise-with-ina-garten/id1678559416?i=1000652708588">Julia Gets Wise with Ina Garten</a>. On this episode of Wiser Than Me, Julia gets enlightened by 76-year-old cook and author Ina Garten. From working on nuclear policy at the White House and operating her famous specialty food store Barefoot Contessa, to penning best-selling books and hosting hit TV shows – Ina has done it all. Her culinary influence goes beyond technique; it's about simplicity and connection. Ina shares how aging has changed her taste in food and how she deals with passive-aggressive people.

<p class="topicTitle">tips & tricks</p>
	
	
<p class="entry">It's not just you:  <a target=_top href="https://www.cultofmac.com/854852/iphone-wake-up-alarm-fail-not-going-off/">iPhone wake-up alarms are failing to go off</a>, reports CultOfMac.  Apple is working on a fix. A possible tip to help you cope in the meantime: Turn off attention-awareness (Accessibility > FaceID & Attention).  Another option might be to use a 3rd party app.  See apps section of today's iPUG.

<p class="topicTitle">gadgets & accessories</p>

It's great for traveling. It's the same one that Bernie reported about in our last iPUG meeting. </p>
