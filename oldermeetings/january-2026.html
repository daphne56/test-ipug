I recounted the priest’s admonition to set aside unwholesome feelings of anger and greed, and work instead to show compassion and generosity, as well as his reminder that his temple was still accepting donations for those affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

“You told me you didn’t speak Japanese,” my guide said, pleasantly surprised.

Beyond a few basic greetings and food terms, I don’t.

<p class="entry">If you want to capture a photo of a subject that is moving and makes it very hard to click at the ideal time, take a burst oh photos instead.  Your iPhone will rapidly take photos in succession until you stop.  You can then review the burst and select the one(s) you want to keep and easily delete the rest.   This is great when you have kids running or a pet that is jumping, and so on.  </p>

The material is very pleasant to hold, it is `vegan leather' and has a really nice texture. What makes it unique is the number of ways it can bend and fold to create different configurations for standing up your ipad: to read, to watch a video, to draw, to write.  They also include a pen holder for free.
