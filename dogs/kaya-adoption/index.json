years ago, Chloe was a stray, roaming the streets of San Diego, but a wonderful rescue group took her in, posted her on Petfinder and I was the lucky one who got to adopt her. This summer, Kaya was let go by a breeder near Temecula, CA, and another wonderful rescue group took her in, posted her on Petfinder. I'll always be grateful to the work of volunteers who help homeless animals. \n\nChloe and Kaya.\n\nKaya and Chloe.\n\nTwo lovely girls, two sisters, one very happy home.\n\n","rich_text":"","text_style":"body","modifiers":[],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":null},{"id":7811480,"updated_at":1437772026,"created_at":1437772026,"content":{"id":7873957,"uuid":410465689171669950,"updated_at":1436457725,"created_at":1436457723,"type":"image","image":{"id":7568522,"uuid":410465689179909250,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"512":{"url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/i/client_uploads/191743/7BB7E9E4-D72B-483A-BE23-BBCE1BCD404E.jpg?w=512&h=512&crop_mode=fit&v=2","size":{"width":512,"height":384}},"1024":{"url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/i/client_uploads/191743/7BB7E9E4-D72B-483A-BE23-BBCE1BCD404E.jpg?w=1024&h=1024&crop_mode=fit&v=2","size":{"width":1024,"height":768}},"2048":{"url":"media/1dff596a-a649-4aea-b3c0-f690dffc8eb7.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1536}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":768},"url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/i/client_uploads/191743/7BB7E9E4-D72B-483A-BE23-BBCE1BCD404E.jpg","preprocessed_url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/api2/media/client_uploads/191743/7BB7E9E4-D72B-483A-BE23-BBCE1BCD404E.jpg","low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":null}],"user":{"updated_at":1465999263,"cached_at":1466157639,"id":191743,"profile_url":"https://www.storehouse.co/mimsynotion","username":"mimsynotion","full_name":"Olga yiparaki","disabled":false,"private":false,"bio":"","instagram_username":"","website":"","authored_channel_id":766298,"favorites_channel_id":766300,"reposts_channel_id":1019578,"hidden_followers":false,"allow_invites_from_strangers":true,"avatar_image":{"id":1380032,"uuid":138305948905559330,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"120":{"url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/i/client_uploads/191743/DA3EF74E-08B3-42B3-A9B8-232E837CD8EA.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop_mode=fit&v=2","size":{"width":115,"height":115}},"320":{"url":"media/ef7a8e2b-e69c-45c9-83dc-13e903273171.jpg","size":{"width":115,"height":115}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":115,"height":115},"url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/i/client_uploads/191743/DA3EF74E-08B3-42B3-A9B8-232E837CD8EA.jpg","preprocessed_url":"https://d12oemfd9cl6ha.cloudfront.net/api2/media/client_uploads/191743/DA3EF74E-08B3-42B3-A9B8-232E837CD8EA.jpg","low_res_preview":null},"cover_image":{},"linked_accounts":[{"id":19673,"service":"twitter","profile_url":"https://twitter.com/mimsynotion","username":"mimsynotion","description":"mimsynotion"}],"following_count":26,"follower_count":36,"stories_count":0,"favorites_count":28,"reposts_count":32,"followed_by_current_user":false},"channels":[],"view_count":271,"sort_time":1436458903,"favorited_by_current_user":false,"reposted_by_current_user":false,"comment_count":5,"blurb":null}
